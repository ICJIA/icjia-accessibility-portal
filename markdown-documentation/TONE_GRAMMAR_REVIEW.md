# FAQ Tone, Syntax, and Grammar Review

## Date: December 31, 2025

## Overview

Comprehensive review and improvements to ensure the FAQ maintains a clear, direct, and diplomatic tone that doesn't denigrate or impugn any segment of the agency (management/exec staff, web developers, content creators).

## Tone Improvements Made

### 1. Softened Language About Executive Staff/Leadership

**Before:** "Your leadership determines whether accessibility is treated as a priority or an afterthought."  
**After:** "Your leadership decisions determine how accessibility is prioritized within the agency."

**Rationale:** Removed accusatory language ("afterthought") while maintaining clarity about leadership's role.

### 2. Removed Implied Criticism of Staff Roles

**Before:** "The owner of your agency's accessibility plan is executive staff — not the web developers."  
**After:** "The agency's accessibility plan is typically owned by executive staff, while web developers focus on technical implementation."

**Rationale:** More neutral framing that doesn't create an "us vs. them" dynamic.

**Before:** "The fact that you're not in executive staff doesn't diminish your expertise"  
**After:** "Your role as a practitioner doesn't diminish your expertise"

**Rationale:** Removed comparison that could be seen as divisive.

**Before:** "Your role as a content creator, not executive staff, gives you..."  
**After:** "Your role as a content creator gives you..."

**Rationale:** Removed unnecessary comparison that could create hierarchy perception.

### 3. Softened Competitive/Comparative Language

**Before:** "you'll be ahead of most content creators"  
**After:** "you'll address the majority of accessibility barriers"

**Rationale:** Removed competitive framing; focused on outcomes instead.

**Before:** "Most accessibility failures come from..."  
**After:** "Most accessibility issues come from..."

**Rationale:** Less judgmental language while maintaining clarity.

### 4. Softened Section Headers

**Before:** "Why 'IT will fix it later' fails"  
**After:** "Why waiting for 'IT will fix it later' doesn't work"

**Rationale:** Less confrontational framing while maintaining the point.

### 5. Consistent Language About Requirements

**Before:** "It's legally required" / "legally required"  
**After:** "It's a compliance requirement" / "compliance requirement"

**Rationale:** Consistent with softened legal language approach throughout.

**Before:** "Accessibility is no longer just 'best practice' — it's the law"  
**After:** "Accessibility is no longer just 'best practice' — it's a compliance requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA"

**Rationale:** More accurate and less absolute language.

**Before:** "When the law requires something"  
**After:** "When compliance requirements specify something"

**Rationale:** Consistent with non-legal framing.

## Grammar and Syntax Improvements

### 1. Added Missing Periods

Added periods to approximately 40+ list items and sentences that were missing them, including:

- Numbered list items in "Why this FAQ can't be shorter"
- List items in "What managers can do/cannot do"
- List items in "Why this information is trustworthy"
- List items in "What web developers did (and didn't do)"
- List items in "How to verify for yourself"
- List items in "Bonus mistakes to avoid"
- Various other bulleted lists throughout

### 2. Fixed Preposition Errors

**Before:** "The fact that you're not in executive staff"  
**After:** "Your role as a practitioner" (removed the problematic phrase entirely)

**Rationale:** Fixed grammatical error and improved clarity.

### 3. Improved Consistency

- Standardized "compliance requirement" language throughout
- Ensured consistent formatting of list items
- Fixed inconsistent capitalization in some references

## Key Principles Applied

### ✅ Clear and Direct (Not Aggressive)

- Maintained direct language about requirements
- Removed accusatory or judgmental phrasing
- Kept factual statements factual

### ✅ Accurate and Concise

- Removed unnecessary comparisons between staff roles
- Eliminated redundant phrasing
- Clarified ambiguous statements

### ✅ Respectful of All Roles

- Removed language that could be seen as criticizing any group
- Framed differences as complementary roles, not hierarchies
- Emphasized collaboration over competition

### ✅ Professional Tone

- Avoided casual or dismissive language
- Maintained formal but approachable tone
- Ensured consistency across all sections

## Remaining Work

### Missing Periods

Approximately 200+ list items still need periods added. This is a formatting consistency issue rather than a tone/grammar issue. The most visible sections have been addressed.

### Areas for Future Review

- Some very long sentences could potentially be broken up for clarity
- Some technical sections could benefit from additional simplification
- Some repetitive phrasing could be streamlined

## Impact

These changes ensure the FAQ:

1. ✅ **Maintains clarity** — Direct language about requirements remains clear
2. ✅ **Avoids denigration** — No language that could be seen as criticizing management, exec staff, web developers, or content creators
3. ✅ **Promotes collaboration** — Language emphasizes shared effort rather than hierarchy
4. ✅ **Improves readability** — Better grammar and punctuation throughout
5. ✅ **Stays professional** — Consistent, respectful tone appropriate for agency-wide communication

## Examples of Improved Tone

### Example 1: Leadership Language

**Before:** "Your leadership determines whether accessibility is treated as a priority or an afterthought."  
**After:** "Your leadership decisions determine how accessibility is prioritized within the agency."

**Why better:** Removes implied criticism while maintaining clarity about leadership's role.

### Example 2: Role Comparisons

**Before:** "The owner of your agency's accessibility plan is executive staff — not the web developers."  
**After:** "The agency's accessibility plan is typically owned by executive staff, while web developers focus on technical implementation."

**Why better:** Neutral framing that doesn't create division; emphasizes complementary roles.

### Example 3: Competitive Language

**Before:** "you'll be ahead of most content creators"  
**After:** "you'll address the majority of accessibility barriers"

**Why better:** Focuses on outcomes rather than comparison with peers.

## Conclusion

The FAQ now maintains a clear, direct, and diplomatic tone that:

- Provides accurate information without being aggressive
- Respects all staff roles without creating hierarchies
- Uses professional language appropriate for agency-wide communication
- Maintains clarity while avoiding denigration

All changes preserve the substantive content while improving tone, grammar, and readability.
