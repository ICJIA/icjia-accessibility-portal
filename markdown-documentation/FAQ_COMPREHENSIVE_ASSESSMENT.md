# Comprehensive FAQ Assessment

## Date: January 2025

## Overall Grade: **B+ (87/100)**

---

## Executive Summary

The FAQs represent a comprehensive, well-sourced, and generally well-structured resource for Illinois state agency employees. The document demonstrates strong technical accuracy, thorough coverage of accessibility topics, and good use of official references. However, there are opportunities to improve organization, reduce redundancies, enhance diplomatic tone in some sections, and streamline content for better usability.

**Key Strengths:**

- ✅ High accuracy with proper source citations
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage of accessibility topics
- ✅ Good use of "Quick answer" format for scannability
- ✅ Strong technical content for web developers
- ✅ Practical guidance for content creators

**Key Areas for Improvement:**

- ⚠️ Some redundancies across sections
- ⚠️ Tone could be more diplomatic in liability sections
- ⚠️ Some questions could be better organized within sections
- ⚠️ A few sections are overly long and could be split

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. ACCURACY: **A (95/100)**

**Strengths:**

- All major claims are properly sourced with official references (DOJ, DoIT, WCAG)
- Technical specifications (WCAG 2.1 Level AA, contrast ratios, etc.) are accurate
- Compliance deadlines and requirements are correctly stated
- Legal distinctions (Title I vs. Title II, IITAA requirements) are accurate

**Minor Issues:**

- Line 116: Broken internal link `#quick-reference-5-critical-act` (should be `#quick-reference-5-critical-actions-by-role`)
- Some references could be more specific (e.g., page numbers or section names for long documents)
- A few statements could benefit from more precise wording (e.g., "most agencies" vs. "many agencies")

**Recommendations:**

1. Fix broken internal link
2. Add more specific citations where possible (section numbers, page references)
3. Verify all external links are still active

---

### 2. TONE & DIPLOMACY: **B (82/100)**

**Strengths:**

- Generally professional and respectful tone
- Good use of "we" language that includes the reader
- Empathetic acknowledgment of workload concerns
- Clear without being condescending

**Areas Needing Improvement:**

**Issue 1: Liability Section Tone (Lines 1322-1599)**

- The liability section, while accurate, can feel defensive or accusatory
- Example: "You won't be named in a DOJ lawsuit, but..." creates unnecessary fear
- Recommendation: Reframe to emphasize positive professional responsibilities rather than legal consequences

**Issue 2: Some Managerial Language**

- Line 1367: "Don't create impossible deadlines" could be more diplomatic
- Line 1376: "Don't approve content that doesn't meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA" is direct but could be softened
- Recommendation: Use more collaborative language ("Work with staff to ensure..." vs. "Don't approve...")

**Issue 3: "Why Trust This FAQ" Section (Lines 371-443)**

- While necessary, this section is somewhat defensive
- The repeated emphasis on "web developer not on executive staff" creates unnecessary hierarchy
- Recommendation: Shorten and reframe to focus on sources rather than author credentials

**Issue 4: Some Absolute Statements**

- "The deadline is firm" appears multiple times (necessary but could vary phrasing)
- "It's not optional" appears frequently (accurate but could be softened)
- Recommendation: Vary language while maintaining clarity

**Recommendations:**

1. **High Priority:** Reframe liability section to emphasize professional responsibilities and support rather than legal consequences
2. **Medium Priority:** Soften managerial directives to be more collaborative
3. **Medium Priority:** Shorten and reframe "Why Trust This FAQ" section
4. **Low Priority:** Vary language around requirements/deadlines to reduce repetition

---

### 3. STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION: **B (85/100)**

**Strengths:**

- Clear section hierarchy (13 main sections)
- Good use of "Quick Reference" at the top
- Logical flow from general to specific
- "Getting Started" section provides good entry points

**Areas Needing Improvement:**

**Issue 1: Question Organization Within Sections**

**"General Accessibility Questions" Section (Lines 76-543):**

- Contains 15 questions covering diverse topics
- Mixes foundational questions with specific concerns
- Recommendation: Split into subsections:
  - Foundational Questions (What is accessibility? What is WCAG?)
  - Compliance Questions (Deadlines, requirements, scope)
  - Getting Help Questions (Who to ask, training resources)

**"Compliance Requirements" Section (Lines 1159-1320):**

- Well-organized but could benefit from clearer subsections
- IITAA and ADA Title II questions are mixed
- Recommendation: Add clear subsections:
  - IITAA Requirements
  - ADA Title II Requirements
  - Exceptions and Exemptions

**"Content Accessibility" Section (Lines 2017-2514):**

- Very long section (497 lines) covering multiple document types
- Recommendation: Split into subsections:
  - General Document Accessibility
  - Word Documents
  - PDFs
  - PowerPoint Presentations
  - Excel Spreadsheets
  - Email and Newsletters

**Issue 2: Redundant Questions**

- "Why is this FAQ so long?" (Line 86) and "Why does accessibility compliance require everyone's participation?" (Line 179) overlap significantly
- "What happens after April 24, 2026?" (Line 938) and "What if we can't meet the deadline?" (Line 977) could be combined
- Recommendation: Consolidate or cross-reference more explicitly

**Issue 3: Cross-References**

- Good use of "See also" links, but could be expanded
- Some related questions aren't cross-referenced
- Recommendation: Add more internal links between related topics

**Recommendations:**

1. **High Priority:** Split "General Accessibility Questions" into logical subsections
2. **High Priority:** Split "Content Accessibility" section into document-type subsections
3. **Medium Priority:** Consolidate redundant questions or add explicit cross-references
4. **Medium Priority:** Add more internal cross-references between related questions
