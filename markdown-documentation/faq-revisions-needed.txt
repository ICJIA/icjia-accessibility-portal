This document contains accuracy and precision issues identified in the FAQ
content at https://accessibility.icjia.app. Each item includes the current
text, the issue identified, and a suggested revision.

===========================================================
ITEM 1: "3-10 times more expensive" claim
===========================================================

LOCATION: Appears in two places:
  - "Why does accessibility compliance require everyone's participation?"
  - "Isn't accessibility just an IT issue?"

CURRENT TEXT:
"Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically **3-10 times more 
expensive** than building accessibility in from the start."

ISSUE:
This statistic is commonly cited but its sourcing is murky. The figure 
originates from general software defect cost research (like Barry Boehm's 
work on defect costs) rather than accessibility-specific studies. It's 
directionally true but not rigorously proven for accessibility specifically.

SUGGESTED REVISION (Option A - remove specific figure):
"Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically **significantly 
more expensive** than building accessibility in from the start—industry 
estimates suggest remediation costs can be several times higher than 
proactive design."

SUGGESTED REVISION (Option B - add qualifier):
"Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically **3-10 times more 
expensive** than building accessibility in from the start, as general software 
defect research suggests."


===========================================================
ITEM 2: Alt text 125-character guideline
===========================================================

LOCATION: "How long should alt text be?"

CURRENT TEXT:
"**Best practice: Aim for 125 characters or fewer** — this is about 15-25 
words. This guideline exists because some older screen readers truncated 
alt text at 125 characters..."

ISSUE:
The 125-character limit is folklore. There's no documented evidence of 
screen readers truncating at this specific limit. JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver 
handle arbitrarily long alt text. The guideline may stem from old CMS field 
limits or SEO tool warnings, not assistive technology behavior.

Your current text actually addresses this well in the "However, modern 
screen readers..." section, but the opening framing still presents 125 
as a meaningful technical threshold.

SUGGESTED REVISION:
"**Best practice: Keep alt text concise—aim for 1-2 sentences in most 
cases.** The commonly cited "125 character limit" isn't a technical 
requirement (modern screen readers handle longer text just fine), but 
brevity helps users process information quickly.

- **Ideal:** Concise and scannable (roughly 15-25 words)
- **Acceptable:** Longer alt text when the image requires detailed description
- **Too short:** Single words like "photo" or "image" don't help anyone
- **Consider alternatives:** If you need extensive description (charts, 
  infographics, diagrams), use a visible caption, long description, or 
  linked text instead of cramming everything into alt text"


===========================================================
ITEM 3: Touch target sizes - iOS vs. Android
===========================================================

LOCATION: "How do I make mobile apps accessible?" under "Core mobile 
accessibility requirements"

CURRENT TEXT:
"**Touch target size** — Interactive elements must be at least 44x44 points 
(iOS) or 48x48 density-independent pixels (Android) to accommodate users 
with motor disabilities"

ISSUE:
This conflates platform design guidelines with WCAG requirements. WCAG 2.1 
AA doesn't specify touch target size—that's Level AAA (SC 2.5.5 Target Size, 
which requires 44x44 CSS pixels). WCAG 2.2 introduced SC 2.5.8 (Target Size 
Minimum) at Level AA, requiring 24x24 CSS pixels minimum.

Since the Title II rule specifies WCAG 2.1 AA, touch target size isn't 
technically required—though it's absolutely best practice.

SUGGESTED REVISION:
"**Touch target size** — While WCAG 2.1 AA doesn't mandate specific sizes, 
platform guidelines recommend at least 44x44 points (iOS) or 48x48 
density-independent pixels (Android) for usability. This is considered 
essential best practice for users with motor disabilities."


===========================================================
ITEM 4: "14px" minimum text size claim
===========================================================

LOCATION: "What are the most common accessibility mistakes to avoid?" 
(item #8 in the table)

CURRENT TEXT:
"Use at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio; avoid text smaller than 14px"

ISSUE:
WCAG doesn't specify a minimum text size. The 14px guidance is reasonable 
UX advice but isn't a compliance requirement. Text size affects *which* 
contrast ratio applies (4.5:1 vs 3:1 for "large text"), but small text 
isn't a violation per se.

SUGGESTED REVISION:
"Use at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text; avoid very small text 
sizes that reduce readability"


===========================================================
ITEM 5: Buttons/links "at least 44x44 pixels"
===========================================================

LOCATION: "What are the most common accessibility mistakes to avoid?" 
(in "Bonus mistakes to avoid" section)

CURRENT TEXT:
"**Making clickable areas too small** — Buttons and links should be at 
least 44x44 pixels"

ISSUE:
Same as Item 3. This isn't a WCAG 2.1 AA requirement. It's AAA in 2.1 
and was only added as AA in WCAG 2.2 (at a smaller 24x24 threshold).

SUGGESTED REVISION:
"**Making clickable areas too small** — For usability, aim for touch 
targets of at least 44x44 pixels (this is strongly recommended best 
practice, though not strictly required by WCAG 2.1 AA)"


===========================================================
ITEM 6: Population threshold phrasing
===========================================================

LOCATION: "When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?" (table)

CURRENT TEXT:
| Entity Size                  | Compliance Deadline |
| Population of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Population less than 50,000  | April 26, 2027      |

ISSUE:
The rule uses "total population" of the *geographic area served*, not the 
entity's employee count or direct service population. For state agencies, 
this is determined by Illinois's total population (12+ million), so all 
state agencies fall under the 2026 deadline regardless of their individual 
size.

Your text is correct but could be slightly clearer in the table itself.

SUGGESTED REVISION:
| Entity Size                                      | Compliance Deadline |
| Entities serving populations of 50,000 or more   | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Entities serving populations under 50,000        | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026** (since 
Illinois has over 12 million residents).


===========================================================
ITEM 7: "Pre-existing documents" exception nuance
===========================================================

LOCATION: "Are there any exceptions to the ADA Title II rule?"

CURRENT TEXT:
"2. **Pre-existing documents** — Documents created before the deadline 
(unless used to apply for or access services)"

ISSUE:
The actual rule language is more nuanced. Documents are covered if they're 
used *by members of the public* to access services. The exception applies 
to documents that exist but aren't actively used in service delivery. 
Your parenthetical is good but could be clearer.

SUGGESTED REVISION:
"2. **Pre-existing conventional electronic documents** — Documents created 
before the compliance date, **unless** currently used by the public to 
participate in or benefit from the entity's services, programs, or activities"


===========================================================
ITEM 8: Outdated ADA.gov link
===========================================================

LOCATION: "How does Title II differ from Title I?" (References section)

CURRENT TEXT:
- **Overview of ADA Titles:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm" ...

ISSUE:
This URL redirects to a different page. The current canonical page is at 
a different location.

SUGGESTED REVISION:
- **Overview of ADA Titles:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/intro-to-ada/" 
  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/topics/intro-to-ada/</a>


===========================================================
OPTIONAL ADDITIONS (not errors, but enhancements)
===========================================================

OPTIONAL 1: WCAG 2.2 mention
----------------------------
Consider adding a brief note somewhere (perhaps in "What is WCAG?" or 
"What does WCAG 2.1 Level AA mean?") that WCAG 2.2 exists (published 
October 2023) and is backward-compatible, but the Title II rule specifically 
requires 2.1 AA—so agencies meeting 2.1 AA are compliant even as standards 
evolve.

SUGGESTED TEXT TO ADD:
"**Note about WCAG versions:** WCAG 2.2 was published in October 2023 and 
adds additional success criteria. However, the ADA Title II rule specifically 
requires WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Content that meets WCAG 2.1 AA is compliant with 
current legal requirements. WCAG versions are backward-compatible, so meeting 
2.2 also means meeting 2.1 and 2.0."


OPTIONAL 2: Audio description clarification
-------------------------------------------
Location: "Do I need to caption all videos?"

Your section mentions audio description but could clarify when it's actually 
required vs. recommended.

CURRENT TEXT:
"**Video with essential visual content** — May require audio description"

SUGGESTED REVISION:
"**Video with essential visual content** — Requires audio description at 
Level AA **only if** important visual information isn't already conveyed 
in the existing audio track. For example, a video where a speaker says 
'as you can see on this chart...' without describing the chart would need 
audio description. A talking-head video where the speaker fully explains 
their points verbally typically does not."
