# Digital Accessibility FAQ for Illinois State Agency Employees

A practical guide to common accessibility questions for staff at Illinois state agencies.

---

## General Accessibility Questions

### What is digital accessibility?

Digital accessibility means that websites, applications, documents, and other digital content are designed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, or alternative keyboards.

### Why does ICJIA need to worry about digital accessibility? What does the April 2026 deadline mean for us?

**As an Illinois state agency, ICJIA has legal obligations under both state and federal law to ensure our digital content is accessible.** The April 24, 2026 compliance deadline is not optional — it's a legal requirement that applies directly to ICJIA.

**Why this matters for ICJIA specifically:**

1. **We're a state agency** — ICJIA falls under the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA), which has required accessible digital content since 2008. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 2024) require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

2. **We serve the public** — ICJIA's mission involves providing information, research, and resources to Illinois residents, criminal justice professionals, and the public. Under ADA Title II, all public-facing digital content must be accessible to people with disabilities.

3. **Millions of Illinois residents need accessible digital content** — According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/impacts/illinois.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC data</a>, approximately **26% of adults in Illinois — over 2.5 million people** — have some type of disability. This includes 7% with a cognitive disability, 6% with mobility limitations, 6% with hearing difficulties, 5% with vision impairment, and 4% who have difficulty with self-care. Many of these individuals rely on accessible digital content to access government services and information. When ICJIA's websites or documents aren't accessible, we're potentially excluding millions of Illinoisans from critical criminal justice information and resources.

4. **Federal funding** — ICJIA receives federal grants. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that any organization receiving federal funding ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities.

5. **The April 2026 deadline is firm** — The U.S. Department of Justice's ADA Title II web accessibility rule (published April 24, 2024) requires state and local governments with populations of 50,000 or more to achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance by **April 24, 2026**. Illinois has over 12 million residents, so this deadline applies to all state agencies including ICJIA.

**What "compliance" actually means:**

- All public-facing web pages must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- All public-facing documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint) must be accessible
- Videos must have captions; audio must have transcripts
- Third-party tools and embedded content we provide must be accessible
- Social media posts going forward must be accessible

**What happens if we don't comply:**

- The DOJ can investigate and pursue enforcement actions
- Individuals can file complaints or lawsuits
- ICJIA could face legal costs, remediation costs, and reputational harm
- Most importantly, people with disabilities would be unable to access our information and services

**The reality of digital accessibility now:**

Accessibility is no longer just "best practice" — it's the law. The 2026 deadline creates accountability for what has always been the right thing to do. For ICJIA, this means integrating accessibility into every aspect of our digital presence: websites, documents, social media, and any tools we provide to the public.

**The good news:** Many accessibility improvements also benefit everyone — clearer content, better-organized documents, and more usable websites make information easier to find and understand for all users.

### Why does accessibility matter?

Accessibility matters for several reasons:

- **Legal compliance** — Federal and state laws require accessible digital content
- **Equal access** — Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. have a disability
- **Better user experience** — Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **Broader reach** — Accessible content can be used by more people in more situations

### Isn't accessibility just an IT issue? Shouldn't the web team fix all these issues?

**No, accessibility is not just an IT issue.** While web developers and IT staff play crucial roles, achieving and maintaining accessibility requires collaboration across all departments and roles in your organization. Accessibility is everyone's responsibility.

**Why accessibility requires organization-wide effort:**

1. **Content creators** — Writers, editors, and content managers must:
   - Write clear, descriptive alt text for images
   - Use proper heading structure in documents
   - Create meaningful link text (not "click here")
   - Ensure color isn't the only way to convey information
   - Add captions to videos or coordinate captioning

2. **Designers** — Graphic designers and UX designers must:
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Design with keyboard navigation in mind
   - Create focus indicators for interactive elements
   - Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning
   - Design forms with proper labels and error messages

3. **Procurement staff** — Purchasing and contract managers must:
   - Include accessibility requirements in RFPs and contracts
   - Request VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates) from vendors
   - Evaluate third-party tools for accessibility before purchase
   - Ensure contract language mandates WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

4. **Project managers and program staff** — Must:
   - Include accessibility in project timelines and budgets
   - Coordinate accessibility testing throughout development
   - Ensure accessibility is considered from project start, not as an afterthought
   - Verify that deliverables meet accessibility standards before launch

5. **IT and web development teams** — Must:
   - Implement accessible code and markup
   - Test with assistive technologies
   - Fix technical accessibility barriers
   - Maintain accessible infrastructure and platforms

6. **Leadership and management** — Must:
   - Allocate resources for accessibility training and tools
   - Establish accessibility policies and procedures
   - Support organization-wide accessibility initiatives
   - Ensure compliance with legal requirements

**The problem with "IT-only" thinking:**

- **Content issues** — If content creators don't write proper alt text or use heading styles, developers can't fix it retroactively without recreating content
- **Design issues** — If designs don't meet contrast requirements or lack focus indicators, developers may need to redesign rather than just code
- **Procurement issues** — If inaccessible tools are purchased, IT may be unable to make them accessible without vendor support
- **Timeline and cost** — Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically 3-10 times more expensive than building accessibility in from the start

**Best practice:** Adopt a "shift-left" approach — consider accessibility at every stage: planning, design, content creation, development, and procurement. This prevents costly retrofitting and ensures better outcomes.

### What laws apply to Illinois state agencies?

Illinois state agencies must comply with multiple accessibility requirements:

| Law/Standard                                                                                                                                                                         | Applies To                                       | Technical Standard       |

### What is WCAG?

WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These are international standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that explain how to make digital content accessible. WCAG is organized around four principles (POUR):

- **Perceivable** — Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Operable** — Interface components must be operable by all users
- **Understandable** — Information and operation must be understandable
- **Robust** — Content must work with current and future technologies

**Learn more:** <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/</a>

### What does "WCAG 2.1 Level AA" mean?

WCAG has three conformance levels:

- **Level A** — Minimum accessibility (must meet)
- **Level AA** — Standard accessibility (should meet) ← _Required for Illinois_
- **Level AAA** — Enhanced accessibility (may meet where feasible)

Illinois requires Level AA conformance, which includes all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

- All state departments, divisions, and agencies
- Constitutional offices
- Public universities

The IITAA does **not** directly apply to:

- Local governments
- School districts
- Community colleges
- Private organizations

**Note:** Local governments and school districts still have obligations under ADA Title II.

### What does the IITAA cover?

The IITAA covers all "information and communication technology," including:

- Websites and web applications
- Software and desktop applications
- Mobile applications
- Electronic documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Multimedia (video and audio)

## ADA Title II Web Rule

### What is the ADA Title II web accessibility rule?

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule establishing specific technical requirements for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rule requires state and local governments to make their public-facing digital content meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official fact sheet:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>

### When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?

| Entity Size                  | Compliance Deadline |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Population of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Population less than 50,000  | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026**.

### Does ADA Title II apply to internal documents?

**No, the ADA Title II web rule does not directly apply to purely internal content.** The rule specifically covers "services, programs, and activities provided or made available" to the public.

**However**, internal content may still need to be accessible under:

- **ADA Title I** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which could include making internal systems accessible
- **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities
- **IITAA** — Illinois law covers intranets and internal systems used by state employees

**Best practice:** Make internal documents accessible proactively. It's easier than retrofitting later, and you may have employees with disabilities who need access.

### What content is covered by the ADA Title II rule?

The rule covers all web content and mobile apps that state and local governments provide or make available to the public, including:

- Websites and web applications
- Mobile apps
- Online documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Online forms and applications
- Social media posts (going forward)
- Video and audio content
- Third-party content provided through contracts or agreements

**ADA Title II Reference:**

### Are there any exceptions to the ADA Title II rule?

Yes, limited exceptions exist for:

1. **Archived content** — Content created before the compliance date that is not currently used for services
2. **Pre-existing documents** — Documents created before the deadline (unless used to apply for or access services)
3. **Third-party content** — Content posted by third parties not under contract
4. **Password-protected individual documents** — Documents specific to one person's account
5. **Pre-existing social media posts** — Posts made before the compliance deadline

**Important:** Even when exceptions apply, you may still need to provide accessible alternatives upon request.

### What are the most common website accessibility issues?

1. **Missing or inadequate alt text** for images
2. **Poor color contrast** between text and background
3. **Missing form labels** — form fields without associated labels
4. **Keyboard inaccessibility** — interactive elements that can't be reached or operated with a keyboard
5. **Missing or improper heading structure** — headings used for styling rather than structure
6. **Missing captions or transcripts** for video/audio content
7. **Links that don't make sense out of context** — "click here" or "read more"
8. **Missing page titles** or duplicate titles across pages
9. **Tables without proper headers** — data tables lacking row/column headers
10. **Auto-playing media** without controls

### What about third-party widgets and embedded content?

You are responsible for the accessibility of third-party content that you embed or integrate into your website through contracts or agreements. This includes:

- Payment processors
- Scheduling tools
- Chat widgets
- Embedded maps
- Social media feeds
- Survey tools

**Best practice:** Request a VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) from vendors before purchasing, and include accessibility requirements in contracts.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a> (see section on "Third-Party Content Provided Through Contracts or Agreements")

### Do embedded dashboards and maps (like Tableau or ArcGIS) need to be accessible?

**Yes, embedded dashboards and maps must be accessible to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements for ADA Title II compliance.** Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, you are responsible for ensuring that all third-party content you embed or integrate into your website is accessible, including data visualization tools like Tableau, mapping services like ArcGIS, and other embedded interactive content.

**Key requirements for embedded content:**

1. **Keyboard accessibility** — All interactive elements (filters, buttons, zoom controls, data points) must be operable using only a keyboard, without requiring mouse interaction.

2. **Screen reader compatibility** — Content must be readable by screen readers, with proper labels, descriptions, and alternative text for visual elements.

3. **Color contrast** — Text and interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components).

4. **Alternative formats** — Provide accessible alternatives when embedded content cannot be made fully accessible:
   - Data tables or CSV exports for dashboards
   - Text descriptions or alternative map formats for geographic information
   - Static images with detailed alt text when interactive features aren't accessible

5. **Focus indicators** — Visible focus indicators must be present for keyboard navigation.

**What to do before embedding:**

- **Request accessibility documentation** — Ask vendors for VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates) or ACRs (Accessibility Conformance Reports) that specifically address WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

- **Test with assistive technology** — Test embedded content with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation before going live.

- **Include accessibility in contracts** — Specify WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements in procurement contracts and service agreements.

- **Provide alternatives** — If embedded content cannot be made fully accessible, provide equivalent accessible alternatives (e.g., downloadable data files, alternative map formats, or text descriptions).

**Vendor-specific considerations:**

- **Tableau** — Tableau has made accessibility improvements, but embedded dashboards may require configuration for full accessibility. Test thoroughly and provide data exports as alternatives.

- **ArcGIS** — ArcGIS Online and embedded maps have accessibility features, but complex interactive maps may need alternative formats. Consider providing static map images with detailed descriptions or alternative navigation methods.

**Remember:** Simply embedding third-party content does not absolve you of accessibility responsibility. If you cannot make embedded content accessible, you must provide accessible alternatives that offer equivalent functionality and information.

## Content Accessibility (Documents, PDFs, Presentations)

### Do all documents need to be accessible?

For public-facing documents, yes. Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, conventional electronic documents must be accessible, including:

- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations

**Exceptions may apply for:**

- Pre-existing documents not currently used for services (still must provide accessible alternatives upon request)
- Password-protected documents specific to an individual's account

### How do I make a Word document accessible?

Key steps for accessible Word documents:

1. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
2. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click > Edit Alt Text
3. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
4. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**

### How do I make a PDF accessible?

The best approach depends on the source:

**If you have the source document (Word, InDesign, etc.):**

1. Make the source document accessible first
2. Export to PDF with accessibility settings enabled
3. Check and fix any remaining issues in Adobe Acrobat Pro

**If you only have the PDF:**

1. Run the Accessibility Checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro
2. Add tags using the Reading Order tool
3. Add alt text to images
4. Set the document language
5. Verify reading order
6. Test with a screen reader

**Testing tool:** PAC 2024 (free) — <a href="https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/</a>

### Is Canva accessible?

Canva has made progress on accessibility features, including:

- Design Accessibility checker (checks contrast, alt text, typography)
- Automatic alt text suggestions
- Reading order and heading tagging for PDFs

**However:** Canva PDFs are not fully WCAG or PDF/UA compliant. If you use Canva:

- Use the Design Accessibility tool before exporting
- Check exported PDFs with PAC or Adobe Acrobat
- Be prepared to remediate PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Pro
- Simpler designs produce better accessibility results

## Social Media Accessibility

### Do social media posts need to be accessible?

Yes. Under the ADA Title II rule, new social media posts by state and local governments must meet accessibility standards. Pre-existing posts (before the compliance deadline) are exempt.

**Note:** Social media platforms themselves have accessibility limitations, but you can control the content you post.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Social Media</a> (see section on "Social Media Posts")

### How do I make social media posts accessible?

**For all platforms:**

- Write in plain language
- Use CamelCase for hashtags (#AccessibilityMatters)
- Limit emoji use; don't place multiple emojis together
- Put hashtags at the end of posts
- Keep videos captioned
- Use sufficient color contrast in graphics

**For images:**

- Add alt text (most platforms support this now)
- Don't put essential text only in images
- Describe images in the post if alt text isn't available

**For video:**

- Add captions (not just auto-generated — review for accuracy)
- Provide audio description for essential visual content if needed

### How do I add alt text on different platforms?

- **X (Twitter):** When composing, click the image > "Add description"
- **Facebook:** Click the image > Edit > Alternative Text
- **Instagram:** Advanced Settings > Write Alt Text (or edit after posting)
- **LinkedIn:** Click the image while composing > Alt text

## Procurement and Third-Party Tools

### What should I do when purchasing software or services?

When procuring technology products or services:

1. **Include accessibility requirements** in RFPs and contracts
2. **Request a VPAT/ACR** (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template / Accessibility Conformance Report)
3. **Evaluate the VPAT** — Look for "Supports" not just "Partially Supports"
4. **Request a demo** of accessibility features
5. **Test with assistive technology** if possible

**IITAA procurement guidance:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html</a>

### What is a VPAT?

A VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) is a standardized document vendors use to describe how their product conforms to accessibility standards. The completed document is called an ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report).

**Evaluate VPATs carefully:**

- Check the date — VPATs older than 1–2 years may be outdated
- Check the version tested — Does it match what you're buying?
- Look at conformance levels (Supports, Partially Supports, Does Not Support)
- Read the remarks/explanations

**VPAT template:** <a href="https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat</a>

### What contract language should I use?

Illinois DoIT recommends including language similar to:

> "All information technology, including electronic information, software, systems, and equipment, developed or provided under this contract or procurement must comply with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (30 ILCS 587) Standards as published at <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa</a>"
