# Digital Accessibility FAQ for Illinois State Agency Employees

A practical guide to common accessibility questions for staff at Illinois state agencies.

## General Accessibility Questions

### What is digital accessibility?

**Quick answer:** Digital accessibility means everyone can use your digital content — websites, documents, videos, apps — regardless of disability.

**Full explanation:**

Digital accessibility means that websites, applications, documents, and other digital content are designed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, or alternative keyboards.

### How does digital accessibility and compliance fit into an agency's DEIA mission?

**Quick answer:** **Accessibility is the "A" in DEIA** — it's how we deliver **equitable access** to services and information by **removing systemic barriers** in our digital work. And it's not just an aspiration: it's backed by **accountability** through enforceable law (IITAA + ADA Title II) and a **measurable standard** (**WCAG 2.1 Level AA**) with a compliance deadline.

**Why this is central to DEIA (not separate from it):**

- **DEIA is about removing systemic barriers to participation** — inaccessible digital content is a barrier that can exclude people with disabilities from information, programs, and services.
- **Government is “digital by default” now** — if the front door is a website, PDF, online form, dashboard, or video, accessibility determines who can actually use the service.
- **Equity becomes measurable** — WCAG 2.1 Level AA turns “we want to be inclusive” into clear, testable expectations for digital equity.
- **Accountability is real** — this goes beyond individual accommodations. IITAA has required accessibility for years, and the ADA Title II web rule reinforces enforceable requirements for public-facing digital content.

**What this means in practice (the DEIA “translation” into daily work):**

1. **Publish accessibly by default** — headings, link text, alt text, captions, and readable structure are part of equitable communication.
2. **Design for everyone** — sufficient contrast, keyboard use, and clear language aren’t “extras”; they determine who can participate.
3. **Procure responsibly** — requiring accessibility in contracts prevents inequity from being “outsourced” to inaccessible vendors/tools.
4. **Fix barriers when found** — treat accessibility issues like service issues, not optional enhancements.
5. **Start now** — timelines and learning approaches can vary, but the obligation to provide accessible services does not.

**The bottom line:** Accessibility is how DEIA commitments show up in the real world — **equitable access, with accountability** — and it’s backed by legal requirements that make the “A” measurable and enforceable.

### Why is there suddenly a deadline for digital accessibility?

**The deadline exists because the federal government finalized specific requirements on April 24, 2024.** The ADA Title II web accessibility rule establishes, for the first time, **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) with **firm deadlines** for state and local governments.

**What changed:**

- **Before April 2024:** Accessibility was required in principle, but enforcement was inconsistent and standards were vague. Agencies knew they should be accessible, but there were no specific technical requirements or firm deadlines.

- **After April 2024:** There are now **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) and **firm compliance deadlines** (April 24, 2026 for entities with populations of 50,000 or more). This creates clear accountability with testable criteria.

**Illinois already had requirements:** The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) has required accessible digital content since 2008. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and many agencies weren't fully aware of their obligations. The new federal rule adds another layer of accountability with a firm deadline.

- <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IITAA History and Requirements</a> — Illinois requirements since 2008

### What does the April 2026 deadline cover?

**Everything digital and public-facing.** The deadline applies to all public-facing digital content, not just websites:

- **Websites and web applications** — All pages and interactive features
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations
- **Multimedia** — Videos (must have captions), audio (must have transcripts)
- **Mobile apps** — Any apps provided to the public
- **Social media** — Posts, images, and videos shared on social platforms (going forward)
- **Third-party content** — Embedded tools, maps, dashboards, widgets provided through contracts

**Why the scope is so broad:** Government services have moved online rapidly, especially since 2020. What used to be in-person services are now digital, making digital accessibility essential for equal access.

**See also:** [How do I make mobile apps accessible?](#how-do-i-make-mobile-apps-accessible)

### Why does accessibility compliance require everyone's participation?

**Because web developers can only fix technical issues — they can't fix content.**

While web developers handle technical implementation (code structure, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes that help screen readers understand interactive elements), they **cannot** fix content created by others. Achieving compliance requires:

- **Content creators** — Write alt text for images, use proper heading styles, make documents accessible, add captions to videos
- **Designers** — Ensure color contrast meets requirements, design with keyboard navigation in mind
- **Procurement staff** — Include accessibility requirements in contracts for third-party tools
- **Web developers** — Implement technical accessibility standards, test with assistive technologies
- **Project managers** — Include accessibility in timelines and ensure it's addressed from project start
- **Leadership** — Allocate time, budget, and resources

**Example:** If you create a PDF report, the web team cannot add alt text to your images, fix your heading structure, or make your tables accessible. Those are content decisions only you can make as the document creator.

**The cost of waiting:** Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically **significantly more expensive** than building accessibility in from the start—industry estimates suggest remediation costs can be several times higher than proactive design.

### Can managers delay accessibility work to "get more information first"?

**The April 24, 2026 deadline is a fixed legal requirement under the ADA Title II web rule.** The rule does not include a routine extension process. While it's completely reasonable for managers to want clarity on scope, timeline, and resources before starting work, the deadline is firm — accessibility work needs to begin now, even as you gather more information.

**Who to ask (so you get answers without losing time):**

- **Your web developers** — Web teams have been working on accessibility for years and can share practical guidance on common barriers, testing, and what “good” looks like. They write code (not your documents), but they’re often the best starting point for accessibility questions in general — especially as timelines get tight.
- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — Best source for questions about the **specific legal mandates** (IITAA + ADA Title II), timelines, and state guidance: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov

**What managers can do:**

- **Ask questions** — Understand what accessibility means for your team's work
- **Clarify scope** — Get a clear picture of what needs to be done
- **Plan resources** — Allocate time and budget needed for compliance
- **Prioritize work** — Determine what needs to be done first
- **Learn while doing** — Start the work now and adjust plans as you gain understanding

**What managers cannot do:**

- **Delay the work** — The deadline is firm (the rule does not include a routine extension process)
- **Treat it as optional** — It's a legal requirement, not a "nice to have"
- **Push it to "later"** — Waiting makes the work more expensive and increases legal risk

**The reality:** Waiting until you fully understand everything will only make compliance harder to achieve. The best approach is to start the work now, ask questions along the way, and adjust plans as you gain more understanding.

### I'm already overloaded — how am I supposed to add accessibility to my workload?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Accessibility isn't additional work on top of your job — it's a change in _how_ you do work you're already doing. Creating an accessible document takes only a few extra minutes once you know the basics.

**Full explanation:**

**We hear you.** Everyone is busy, and "one more thing" feels impossible. But here's the reframe: you're already creating documents, adding images, and publishing content. Accessibility is about doing those things _slightly differently_ — not doing more things.

**The real time investment:**

| Task                                                       | Extra Time    | Notes                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Adding alt text to an image                                | 30 seconds    | You know what's in the image — just describe it   |
| Using heading styles instead of bold                       | 0 seconds     | Same number of clicks, different button           |
| Writing "Download the 2025 Report" instead of "Click here" | 5 seconds     | Better for everyone, not just accessibility       |
| Running the Accessibility Checker in Word                  | 60 seconds    | Built into Microsoft Office — one click           |
| Adding captions to a 5-minute video                        | 10-15 minutes | This one does take time (but is legally required) |

**What actually takes time:**

- **Remediating old content** — Yes, this is real work. Prioritize by impact and chip away at it.
- **Learning the basics** — About 15-30 minutes to learn the essentials. Do it once, apply forever.
- **Complex documents** — Tables, forms, and multi-column layouts require more attention.

**What to tell your manager:**

If you genuinely don't have bandwidth, escalate it. Say: _"Accessibility is now required by law. I need either (a) time allocated for training and remediation, or (b) clarity on what gets deprioritized to make room for this."_

**The reality:** Accessibility is a legal requirement, not optional. However, managers do need to allocate realistic time and resources for staff to learn and implement accessibility practices. If you're genuinely overloaded, the solution isn't to skip accessibility — it's to work with your manager to prioritize and allocate time appropriately.

**Start small:**

1. Learn one thing this week (alt text is the easiest)
2. Apply it to everything you create going forward
3. Add another skill next week

**The bottom line:** You don't have to fix everything at once. But you do have to start — and starting is smaller than you think.

### Who is affected by inaccessible digital content?

**Quick answer:** Illinois residents with disabilities — including vision, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments — require accessible digital content to access government services. The <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA)</a>, overseen by Illinois DoIT, requires that all state agency digital content be accessible to people with disabilities.

**Full explanation:**

**Illinois residents with disabilities need accessible digital content.** The IITAA has required accessible digital content since 2008, and Illinois DoIT provides guidance and oversight for state agencies to ensure compliance.

When digital content isn't accessible, agencies exclude Illinois residents with disabilities from accessing government information and services. Common disabilities include:

- **Vision impairments** — Blindness, low vision, color blindness
- **Hearing impairments** — Deafness, hearing loss
- **Motor disabilities** — Difficulty using a mouse, limited hand mobility
- **Cognitive disabilities** — Learning disabilities, memory difficulties, attention disorders

**Why this matters:** Accessible digital content isn't just about legal compliance — it's about ensuring equal access to government services for Illinois residents with disabilities, as required by IITAA.

### What is WCAG?

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** are international standards that explain how to make digital content accessible to people with disabilities. Think of them as a detailed checklist for making websites, documents, and apps usable by everyone.

WCAG is organized around four principles, known as **POUR**:

- **Perceivable** — People must be able to see or hear content (or have it described by assistive technology). Example: Images need text descriptions for people who can't see them.
- **Operable** — People must be able to use interface components and navigate content. Example: Everything that works with a mouse must also work with a keyboard.
- **Understandable** — Content and how to use it must be clear. Example: Error messages should explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **Robust** — Content must work with different technologies, including assistive tools like screen readers. Example: Use standard HTML so assistive technologies can interpret the content.

**Learn more:** <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/</a>

### What does "WCAG 2.1 Level AA" mean?

WCAG has three conformance levels:

- **Level A** — Minimum accessibility (must meet)
- **Level AA** — Standard accessibility (should meet) ← _Required for Illinois_
- **Level AAA** — Enhanced accessibility (may meet where feasible)

Illinois requires Level AA conformance, which includes all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

**Note about WCAG versions:** WCAG 2.2 was published in October 2023 and adds additional success criteria. However, the ADA Title II rule specifically requires WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Content that meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA is compliant with current legal requirements. WCAG versions are backward-compatible, so meeting 2.2 also means meeting 2.1 and 2.0.

### Isn't accessibility just an IT issue? Shouldn't the web team fix all these issues?

**No. Accessibility is an organization-wide responsibility.** IT and web teams can fix technical barriers, but they can’t retroactively “repair” inaccessible content, designs, or procurement decisions without rework.

**Who owns what (high-level):**

- **Content creators**: headings, links, alt text, document structure, captions/transcripts
- **Designers**: contrast, focus visibility, layouts that work with keyboard/screen readers
- **Procurement/program teams**: require WCAG 2.1 Level AA in contracts; avoid buying inaccessible tools
- **Web/IT**: accessible code, testing, fixes, platform configuration
- **Managers/leaders**: time, tools, training, accountability

**Why “IT will fix it later” fails:**

- Accessibility is cheapest when done early; retrofits can be **significantly more expensive**—industry estimates suggest remediation costs can be several times higher than proactive design.
- A PDF without headings/alt text, a low-contrast design, or an inaccessible vendor tool can’t be “patched” by IT without changing the original work.

**Best practice:** Plan for accessibility early — address it in **content + design + procurement + build** from the start, not at the end. (This is sometimes called "shifting left" in project management terminology.)

### I prefer to talk to someone rather than read FAQs. Who can I ask?

**Questions are welcome, and there are many ways to learn.** Whether you prefer reading, watching videos, hands-on practice, or talking to someone, resources exist for you. That said, the work and deadline remain the same regardless of format — you'll still need to make your content accessible. Here's who to ask:

**Find your agency's accessibility coordinator.** Every agency should have someone responsible for accessibility planning and compliance. This person can answer general questions, provide presentations, and connect you to resources. The owner of your agency's accessibility plan is executive staff — not the web developers.

**For practical accessibility questions, ask your web developers.** ICJIA web developers have been working on website accessibility for years and are happy to share what they know. They're your best first stop for practical guidance on web content. However, keep in mind that web developers implement _web_ accessibility — the Title II rule is much bigger than just websites (it covers documents, videos, social media, mobile apps, and third-party tools).

**For legal/mandate questions, ask DoIT.** The Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility has a dedicated accessibility coordinator who can answer questions about specific legal requirements (IITAA + ADA Title II), timelines, and state guidance: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov

**Other learning formats (if FAQs aren't your thing):**

**Bottom line:** Ask questions, use whatever format works for you — but start the work now. The April 24, 2026 deadline applies regardless of how you prefer to learn.

### I prefer to get information from executive staff. Who should I talk to about accessibility? Can I trust information from web developers and content creators who aren't part of executive staff?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** For strategic and legal questions about scope, timeline, and organizational impact, talk to your agency's accessibility coordinator or executive staff. For practical implementation questions, your web developers and content creators have hands-on experience and are excellent resources — even if they're not in leadership roles. You don't need to trust web developers personally — trust the verified sources these FAQs cite. Every claim links back to official, authoritative sources (DOJ, Illinois DoIT, WCAG standards) that you can verify yourself.

**Full explanation:**

**Understanding the different roles:**

**For strategic and legal questions (scope, timeline, organizational impact):**

- **Your agency's accessibility coordinator** — This person (often in executive or compliance roles) understands the full scope of requirements across all content types
- **Executive staff** — They own the agency's accessibility plan and can address resource allocation, priorities, and organizational strategy
- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — For legal/mandate questions: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov

**For practical implementation questions (how to fix issues, what tools to use, testing approaches):**

- **Your web developers** — Many web teams have been implementing accessibility standards for years. They understand WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements, testing tools, common barriers, and remediation approaches. Their expertise is valuable even if they're not in executive roles.
- **Recent ICJIA content creators** — Several content creators from ICJIA's research and analysis unit have been trained on accessibility best practices and are already solving accessibility issues in their work.

**The key distinction:**

- **Scope and strategy** = Executive staff.
- **Implementation and technical details** = Web developers, technical teams, and recent content creators.

**Why this information is trustworthy (regardless of who compiled it):**

- **All content is sourced and verified** — Every claim links back to official, authoritative sources (DOJ, DoIT, WCAG) that you can verify yourself. These are the same sources legal teams and compliance officers use
- **Web developers have no reason to mislead** — Web developers are working through accessibility compliance requirements just like everyone else — in some cases, they're dealing with more of it than others since they're implementing accessibility standards across multiple websites. They have no incentive to provide inaccurate information
- **They're sharing what they've learned** — Web developers have been implementing WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for years and have encountered real-world challenges. They've compiled what they've learned into these FAQs to help others avoid the same pitfalls
- **The information is verifiable** — You don't have to take anyone's word for it. Every FAQ answer includes links to official sources. If you have concerns, check the sources yourself or go directly to DoIT, DOJ, or W3C documentation

**These FAQs are based on official, verifiable sources:**

- **Legal requirements** — All information about deadlines, standards, and requirements comes directly from:
  - <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/24/2024-07758/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-accessibility-of-web-information-and-services-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Register: ADA Title II Final Rule (April 24, 2024)</a> — The actual legal text
  - <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOJ ADA Title II Fact Sheet</a> — Official DOJ summary
  - <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT IITAA Requirements</a> — Official state guidance

- **Technical standards** — WCAG requirements come from:
  - <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C WCAG 2.1 Specification</a> — The official standard
  - <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C WCAG Quick Reference</a> — Filterable checklist

- **State guidance** — Illinois-specific information comes from:
  - <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/doit-news/accessibility-news/iitaa-2-1-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT IITAA 2.1 Update</a> — Official announcement of effective dates
  - <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT Accessibility Office</a> — Official state resources

**What web developers did (and didn't do):**

- **Did:** Compiled information from official sources, organized it into a practical format, added examples and workflows based on real-world experience
- **Did:** Cross-referenced multiple sources to ensure accuracy and consistency
- **Did:** Included direct links to official sources so you can verify everything yourself
- **Did NOT:** Create new legal requirements or standards
- **Did NOT:** Interpret legal requirements without citing sources
- **Did NOT:** Add opinions or unsupported claims

**How to verify for yourself:**

1. **Check the sources** — Every FAQ answer includes "References" sections with links to official sources
2. **Compare with DoIT guidance** — The information here aligns with what Illinois DoIT publishes
3. **Verify legal requirements** — Links to Federal Register and DOJ documents let you read the actual legal text
4. **Cross-reference WCAG** — Technical requirements link directly to W3C WCAG documentation

**For web developers and technical teams:**

If you've been working on accessibility for years, your expertise is valuable and needed. Managers may initially seek executive staff for strategic questions, but your practical knowledge is essential for implementation. Don't hesitate to share what you know — your hands-on experience with WCAG 2.1 Level AA, testing tools, and remediation approaches is exactly what teams need to succeed. The fact that you're not in executive staff doesn't diminish your expertise; it means you have the practical, day-to-day knowledge that makes accessibility work.

**For content creators already creating accessible content:**

Your training in accessibility best practices and your current work solving accessibility issues means you have real-world expertise that matters. While managers may turn to executive staff for high-level strategy, your day-to-day experience creating accessible documents, testing content, and applying WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards is what actually gets the work done. Speak up about what you know — your practical skills with document remediation, testing tools, and accessibility workflows are exactly what your agency needs. Your role as a content creator, not executive staff, gives you the ground-level perspective that makes accessibility implementation successful.

**The bottom line:** Different questions require different people. For "what's the full scope?" talk to leadership. For "how do I fix this?" talk to your web developers or recent content creators. Both perspectives are needed, and both are valuable. You may or may not trust specific web developers personally, but you can trust that this content has been verified and sourced. Every claim can be traced back to DOJ, DoIT, or W3C sources. Web developers compiled and organized this information — they're working through accessibility compliance just like everyone else (in some cases, more so), and they have no reason to mislead anyone. They've included what they've learned in these FAQs to help others. The point isn't to trust web developers — it's to trust the verified information here, or if you prefer, go directly to the original sources. The FAQs are a practical guide, but the authoritative sources (DOJ, DoIT, W3C) are always the final word.

**See also:** [I prefer to talk to someone rather than read FAQs. Who can I ask?](#i-prefer-to-talk-to-someone-rather-than-read-faqs) — This question covers who to contact for different types of accessibility questions, including DoIT for legal/mandate questions (DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov)

### I'm waiting for a presentation on accessibility. Should I start work in my unit based on the info in this FAQ or wait for the DoIT presentation?

{new:2025-12-28}

**Quick answer:** Start work now. Don't wait for a presentation. The April 24, 2026 deadline doesn't change based on when you receive training. A DoIT presentation can be very helpful for Q&A and agency-specific guidance, but it's not a prerequisite for beginning accessibility work.

**Why start now:**

- **The deadline is firm** — April 24, 2026 applies to everyone, regardless of when training happens
- **The basics are available now** — These FAQs cover the core requirements and common fixes. A presentation adds context and Q&A, but you can begin with the fundamentals today.
- **The work is difficult and time-consuming** — There is no one-click fix for accessibility. Making content accessible requires manual work: adding alt text, fixing heading structure, remediating PDFs, adding captions. A presentation may clarify requirements, but it won't speed up compliance — the work still needs to be done
- **You can learn as you go** — Start with the most common issues (see: [What are the most common accessibility mistakes to avoid?](#what-are-the-most-common-accessibility-mistakes-to-avoid)) and build from there

**What you can start doing today:**

1. **Add alt text to images** — Every image needs a brief description
2. **Use heading styles** — Use Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 instead of just making text bold
3. **Write descriptive links** — Instead of "click here," write "Download the 2025 Annual Report"
4. **Check color contrast** — Make sure text is dark enough against its background (4.5:1 ratio for normal text)
5. **Add captions to videos** — All videos need captions

**What to do while waiting for the presentation:**

- **Start with your most recent content** — Fix accessibility issues in documents, PDFs, or web pages you've created recently
- **Use the resources in these FAQs** — The links and guides here are the same ones DoIT will reference
- **Ask your web developers or content creators** — If your unit has people already working on accessibility, they can help you get started
- **Request the presentation** — Contact DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov to schedule training, but don't delay work until then

**What the presentation provides (that this FAQ doesn't):**

- **A chance to ask questions** — The main value of a presentation is the opportunity to ask specific questions about your agency's situation, get clarification on complex issues, and discuss edge cases
- **Interactive discussion** — You can discuss your specific challenges with DoIT staff and other agencies
- **Clarification on confusing points** — If something in these FAQs is unclear, you can ask for clarification

**Important reality check:**

- **The presentation won't speed up compliance** — A presentation may clarify requirements, but it won't make the work faster. There is no one-click fix for accessibility. The work is difficult and requires manual remediation of content
- **The baseline guidance is already here** — This FAQ is a strong starting point. Use the presentation to ask questions, confirm edge cases, and get agency-specific guidance.
- **The deadline doesn't wait** — April 24, 2026 is the same for everyone, whether you receive training in January or June

### What are the most common accessibility mistakes to avoid?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Most accessibility failures come from a small set of common mistakes. Avoid these 10 things and you'll prevent the majority of accessibility issues.

**Top 10 accessibility mistakes (and what to do instead):**

| ❌ Don't do this                                                                            | ✅ Do this instead                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Skip alt text on images** — "The image is self-explanatory"                            | Write alt text for every image. If you took the photo for a reason, that reason needs words.           |
| **2. Use "Click here" or "Read more" for links** — Screen readers read links out of context | Write descriptive links: "Download the 2025 Annual Report" or "View training schedule"                 |
| **3. Make text bold instead of using heading styles** — Looks like a heading but isn't one  | Use Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 styles. Screen readers use headings to navigate.                   |
| **4. Put essential info only in images** — Images may not load or be visible                | Always include the same information as text in the document or caption                                 |
| **5. Use color alone to convey meaning** — "Required fields are in red"                     | Use text labels, icons, or patterns in addition to color                                               |
| **6. Create PDFs by scanning paper** — Results in an image, not readable text               | Use OCR or create documents digitally with proper structure                                            |
| **7. Skip captions on videos** — "People can figure it out"                                 | Always add captions. It's legally required and benefits everyone.                                      |
| **8. Use tiny or low-contrast text** — Light gray on white, small fonts                     | Use at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text; avoid very small text sizes that reduce readability |
| **9. Build complex tables with merged cells** — Screen readers can't interpret them         | Use simple tables with clear headers; avoid merging cells when possible                                |
| **10. Assume "IT will fix it later"** — Accessibility is everyone's job                     | Make accessibility part of your workflow from the start                                                |

**Bonus mistakes to avoid:**

- **Autoplaying audio or video** — Always give users control
- **Removing focus indicators** — The blue outline helps keyboard users know where they are
- **Using placeholder text as labels** — Placeholder text disappears when you start typing
- **Making clickable areas too small** — For usability, aim for touch targets of at least 44x44 pixels (this is strongly recommended best practice, though not strictly required by WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
- **Flashing or blinking content** — Can trigger seizures; as a safe rule, avoid any flashing content entirely, or ensure nothing flashes more than 3 times in any one-second period

**The bottom line:** Most accessibility issues aren't complicated — they're just habits we haven't formed yet. Avoid these common mistakes and you'll be ahead of most content creators.

**Quick self-check:** Before publishing any content, ask yourself:

1. Does every image have alt text?
2. Are my links descriptive?
3. Did I use heading styles (not just bold)?
4. Can I understand the content without seeing colors?
5. Do my videos have captions?

If you can answer "yes" to all five, you've avoided the most common problems.

## Getting Started

### I'm a content creator. Where do I start?

**As a content creator, your role is crucial — you're often the first person to make content accessible (or inaccessible).** Here's your quickstart guide:

**DoIT best practice:** Illinois DoIT generally recommends publishing content as webpage text when feasible instead of relying on PDFs. In practice, HTML webpage text is often easier to make and keep accessible than PDFs—especially when the alternative is a short webpage summary that links to a PDF that may or may not be accessible. This DoIT best practice aligns with WCAG 2.1 Level AA rules and ADA Title II requirements. When possible, publish content as webpage text rather than PDFs.

**Visual example of accessible vs. inaccessible content:**

_Inaccessible approach:_ A webpage with two sentences and a link: "Our agency published its annual report. [Click here to download PDF]"

- Screen reader users hear: "Our agency published its annual report. Link: click here"
- Problem: No context about what the PDF contains, and the PDF itself may be inaccessible

_Accessible approach:_ Full report content published as webpage text with proper headings, alt text for images, and accessible tables

- Screen reader users can navigate by headings, read all content, and understand the full report
- Alternative: If PDF is necessary, provide both webpage summary AND accessible PDF with clear description

**Start here (15 minutes) — Essential skills everyone needs:**

1. **Alt text for images** — Write a brief description of what's in every image (think: "If I were describing this over the phone, what would I say?")
2. **Use heading styles** — In Word/PowerPoint, use the Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 styles instead of just making text bigger
3. **Write clear link text** — Instead of "click here," write "Download the 2025 Annual Report"
4. **Check color contrast** — Make sure text is dark enough to read against its background

**These four skills will address 60-70% of common accessibility issues.**

**Learn the details (30 minutes each):**

**The key mindset shift:** Think about how someone using a screen reader (software that reads content aloud) or keyboard navigation would experience your content. If they can't see images, colors, or mouse interactions, can they still understand and use your content? If not, you need to provide alternatives.

### I'm a web developer. Where do I start?

**As a developer, you're building the foundation that makes everything else possible.** Here's your roadmap:

**Week 1 priority (must-do):**

1. **Keyboard navigation** — Ensure everything works without a mouse: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility</a>
2. **Semantic HTML** — Use proper HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>` not `<div>`): <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C: Page Structure</a>
3. **Form labels** — Every form field needs a proper label: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Forms</a>
4. **Install testing tools** — Get axe DevTools or WAVE browser extensions running

**Core technical standards:**

- **WCAG Quick Reference** — <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference</a> — Filter by Level AA
- **ARIA Authoring Practices** — <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C ARIA APG</a> (use semantic HTML first; ARIA second)
- **MDN Accessibility Guide** — <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla: Accessibility</a>

**See also:** [How do I test my website for accessibility?](#how-do-i-test-my-website-for-accessibility) | [What are the most common website accessibility issues?](#what-are-the-most-common-website-accessibility-issues)

**Essential development practices:**

- **Focus management** — Visible focus indicators and logical tab order: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WCAG: Focus Visible</a>
- **Automate what you can** — Add <a href="https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a> and use <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a> in CI/tests where feasible

**ARIA usage specifics:**

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) should be used when semantic HTML isn't sufficient. Here's when and how:

**When to use ARIA:**

- **Dynamic content updates** — Use `aria-live` regions to announce changes (e.g., form validation messages, search results)
- **Complex widgets** — Use ARIA patterns for custom components (accordions, modals, tabs) that don't have native HTML equivalents
- **Hidden content** — Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative elements that screen readers should skip
- **Form relationships** — Use `aria-describedby` to link error messages to form fields
- **Button states** — Use `aria-expanded` for collapsible content, `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons

**ARIA best practices:**

1. **Prefer semantic HTML** — Use `<button>` not `<div role="button">`, `<nav>` not `<div role="navigation">`
2. **Don't change semantics** — Don't add ARIA that conflicts with native HTML (e.g., `role="button"` on a `<button>`)
3. **Test with screen readers** — ARIA that looks correct in code may not work as expected; always test
4. **Keep it simple** — If you can solve it with HTML, don't add ARIA

**Common ARIA patterns:**

- **Error messages:** `<input aria-describedby="error-id">` + `<div id="error-id" role="alert">Error text</div>`
- **Skip links:** `<a href="#main" aria-label="Skip to main content">Skip to content</a>`
- **Modal dialogs:** `role="dialog"` + `aria-labelledby` + `aria-modal="true"` + focus trap
- **Progress indicators:** `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`

**Resources:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide</a> — Complete patterns and examples
- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARIA Patterns</a> — Specific widget patterns

**Testing tools (integrate into your workflow):**

- **Automated checks** — axe DevTools or WAVE (plus Lighthouse as a secondary signal)
- **Manual checks** — keyboard-only + at least one screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver): <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVDA download</a>

**Deepen skills (optional):** <a href="https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev Learn Accessibility</a> and Illinois DoIT training: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html</a>

**Code review checklist (use this before every release):**

✓ Semantic HTML structure  
✓ Keyboard navigation works throughout  
✓ Focus indicators are visible  
✓ Color contrast meets 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text)  
✓ Images have alt text (or are marked decorative)  
✓ Forms have proper labels and error messages  
✓ ARIA is used correctly (or semantic HTML is preferred)  
✓ Automated tests pass (axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse)

**The key mindset:** Build accessibility in from the start, not as an afterthought. It's much easier and cheaper than retrofitting later. Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers regularly, not just at the end.

### I'm a manager. Where do I start?

**As a manager, your role is to create the organizational conditions for accessibility success.** You don't need to become a technical expert — you need to set priorities, fund time/tools, and create accountability.

**Manager quick checklist (start here):**

1. **Name an owner** (or coordinator) for accessibility work and reporting
2. **Inventory what you publish** (sites, forms, PDFs, videos, social posts, vendor tools)
3. **Prioritize by impact** (high-traffic + high-stakes services first)
4. **Bake accessibility into process** (before publish / before purchase / before launch)
5. **Track progress** to the deadline (clear milestones, regular check-ins)

**1. Understand the legal requirements and timeline:**

- **The deadline is firm** — April 24, 2026 for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- **It applies to everything** — Websites, documents, videos, social media, mobile apps
- **It's not optional** — This is a legal requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA
- **Read the basics** — <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a> — Plain language summary of requirements
- **Primary source (final rule text)** — <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/24/2024-07758/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-accessibility-of-web-information-and-services-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Register: ADA Title II Web Rule (April 24, 2024)</a>

**2. Assess your current state:**

- **Audit existing content** — Identify all public-facing digital content (websites, documents, videos, social media)
- **Prioritize by impact** — Focus on high-traffic pages, frequently accessed documents, and critical services first
- **Identify gaps** — Use automated tools and manual testing to find accessibility issues
- **Estimate remediation effort** — Understand the scope of work needed

**3. Build accessibility into your processes:**

- **Include accessibility in project timelines** — Don't treat it as an add-on; build it into initial project plans
- **Require accessibility in procurement** — Include WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements in RFPs and vendor contracts
- **Establish content review processes** — Ensure documents and content are checked for accessibility before publication
- **Create accessibility checkpoints** — Build accessibility reviews into your content approval workflows

**4. Allocate resources strategically:**

- **Training budget** — Invest in accessibility training for content creators, developers, and designers
- **Tools and software** — Provide accessibility testing tools (WAVE, axe DevTools, PDF accessibility checkers)
- **Time allocation** — Recognize that creating accessible content may take slightly longer initially
- **Expert support** — Consider accessibility consultants or specialists for complex projects

**5. Support your team:**

- **Make it a priority** — Communicate that accessibility is important and expected
- **Remove barriers** — Ensure staff have access to training, tools, and time needed
- **Celebrate progress** — Recognize teams and individuals who successfully implement accessibility
- **Learn alongside your team** — Attend training sessions to understand what your team is learning

**6. Establish accountability:**

- **Assign responsibilities** — Clearly define who is responsible for accessibility in each area
- **Set expectations** — Make accessibility part of job descriptions and performance expectations
- **Track progress** — Monitor compliance status and remediation efforts
- **Regular check-ins** — Include accessibility in regular team meetings and project reviews

**7. Connect with resources:**

- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — Email: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov — Website: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/</a>
- **Accessibility coordinators** — Identify or designate an accessibility coordinator in your organization
- **Peer networks** — Connect with other managers facing similar challenges
- **Legal/compliance team** — Work with your legal or compliance office to understand requirements

**8. Keep it sustainable (so it doesn't collapse after one push):**

- Build accessibility into ongoing operations (publish + purchase + build), not a one-time project
- Maintain documentation, milestones, and ownership

**The bottom line:** As a manager, you don't need to become a technical expert, but you do need to create the organizational support, resources, and accountability that enable your team to succeed. The April 2026 deadline is firm, but with proper planning and support, your organization can achieve compliance.

### What exactly am I accountable for as a manager (vs. what my team is accountable for)?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** You’re accountable for **making accessibility possible and expected**: ownership, priorities, time/tools/training, and accountability. Your team is accountable for **creating and maintaining accessible content and systems** in their day-to-day work.

**Manager accountabilities (what you control):**

- **Ownership** — Name a coordinator/owner and make reporting routine
- **Resourcing** — Allocate time, tools, and training (and remove blockers)
- **Process** — Require accessibility checks before publish/purchase/launch
- **Accountability** — Define responsibilities clearly and track progress to the deadline

**Team accountabilities (what they do):**

- **Content creators** — headings, link text, alt text, accessible documents, captions/transcripts
- **Developers/IT** — accessible code, testing, fixing defects, vendor integration requirements
- **Procurement/program teams** — require WCAG 2.1 AA and review VPAT/ACRs before purchase

**Helpful framing:** Accessibility is a compliance deliverable like security and privacy — it needs ownership, a plan, and execution across roles.

### How can I track and demonstrate “good-faith progress” toward compliance?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** Maintain a clear inventory, a prioritized backlog, and evidence of steady progress (what was fixed, when, and what’s next).

**Practical manager artifacts (simple, defensible):**

1. **Inventory** of public-facing content/tools (web, PDFs, forms, videos, social, vendor tools)
2. **Prioritized backlog** (top services + top traffic + complete blockers first)
3. **Milestones** (monthly/quarterly targets through April 2026)
4. **Evidence** (audit results, remediation logs, training completion, procurement language)
5. **Escalation path** (who decides tradeoffs when priorities conflict)

**Why this helps:** It prevents “we didn’t know” and gives leadership a concrete way to support resourcing decisions.

### ICJIA has many public sites. Where can I see the audit reports for each site?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** ICJIA web developers are methodically adding accessibility reports for each public site. Look for an "Accessibility Report" link in the footer of ICJIA websites. Here's the accessibility report for this website: <a href="https://accessibility.icjia.app/docs/accessibility/index.html" onclick="event.preventDefault(); window.location.href = 'https://accessibility.icjia.app/docs/accessibility/index.html'; return false;">Accessibility Report for this portal</a>

**Full explanation:**

**Web developers are working through adding reports for each site.** The goal is to provide accessibility reports for all ICJIA public websites. These reports are being added systematically as web developers audit and document each site.

**How to find reports:**

- **Look in the footer** — Most ICJIA sites will have an "Accessibility Report" link in the footer (similar to this portal)
- **Reports are site-specific** — Each website will have its own report documenting that site's accessibility status

**Important limitations:**

- **These reports cover websites only** — The accessibility reports use <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a> to run automated accessibility tests for the websites themselves (HTML structure, navigation, forms, etc.)
- **They do NOT cover content files** — The reports do not test or document accessibility of PDFs, Excel files, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, or other content files hosted on the sites. Content accessibility is the responsibility of content creators, not web developers.
- **Automated testing has limits** — While axe-core catches many issues, manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers is still required for full compliance

**What this means for content creators:**

If you're creating documents, PDFs, or other content files, you're responsible for making those accessible — the website accessibility reports don't cover your content. See: [Do all documents need to be accessible?](#do-all-documents-need-to-be-accessible) | [How do I make a PDF accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-pdf-accessible) | [How do I make a Word document accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-word-document-accessible)

### Who should be our agency's accessibility coordinator?

{new:2025-12-28}

**Quick answer:** The accessibility coordinator should be someone in executive or compliance roles who has organizational authority to set policy, allocate resources, and make strategic decisions. While web developers and content creators have valuable technical expertise, the coordinator role requires someone who can make agency-wide decisions and set policy — not just implement technical solutions.

**What the coordinator does:**

The accessibility coordinator needs to:

- **Set organizational policy** — Make decisions about accessibility standards, priorities, and processes that apply agency-wide
- **Allocate resources** — Approve budgets, training, tools, and time allocation for accessibility work
- **Coordinate with technical teams** — Meet with and talk to web developers and content creators who are currently involved in accessibility compliance work. These teams are busy doing the actual compliance work, so the coordinator should gather information from them and report back to executive staff about progress, challenges, and resource needs.
- **Report to executive staff** — Provide updates on compliance status, risks, and progress to leadership

**Who should be the coordinator:**

The accessibility coordinator should be someone who has organizational authority (often in executive, compliance, or management roles) and can:

- Make policy decisions and allocate resources
- Understand the full scope (websites, documents, videos, social media, mobile apps, third-party tools)
- Coordinate across departments (IT, communications, legal, procurement, content teams)
- Report to executive staff with strategic recommendations

**Common coordinator roles:** Compliance officer, IT director/manager, communications director, program manager, or executive staff member.

**The key distinction:**

- **Accessibility coordinator** = Sets policy, allocates resources, makes strategic decisions, coordinates with technical teams, reports to executive staff (needs organizational authority)
- **Web developers and content creators** = Provide technical expertise, implement solutions, do the actual compliance work (valuable resources, but typically not policy setters)

**Bottom line:** The accessibility coordinator needs organizational authority to set policy and allocate resources. The coordinator should meet with web developers and content creators who are doing the compliance work, gather information from them, and report back to executive staff. Web developers and content creators are essential technical resources, but they're busy doing the work — the coordinator's role is to coordinate, gather information, and make strategic decisions at the organizational level.

## State Agency Applicability

### Why does your agency need to worry about digital accessibility? What does the April 2026 deadline mean?

**As an Illinois state agency, your agency has legal obligations under both state and federal law to ensure digital content is accessible.** The April 24, 2026 compliance deadline is not optional — it's a legal requirement that applies directly to all Illinois state agencies.

**Why this matters for Illinois state agencies:**

1. **State agency status** — Illinois state agencies fall under the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA), which has required accessible digital content since 2008. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 24, 2024) require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

2. **Public service mission** — State agencies provide information, research, and resources to Illinois residents. Under ADA Title II, all public-facing digital content must be accessible to people with disabilities.

3. **Illinois residents with disabilities need accessible digital content** — The <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA)</a>, overseen by Illinois DoIT, requires that all state agency digital content be accessible to people with disabilities. Common disabilities include mobility limitations, cognitive difficulties, hearing difficulties, and vision impairment. Illinois residents with disabilities rely on accessible digital content to access government services and information. When state agency websites or documents aren't accessible, we're excluding Illinois residents with disabilities from critical government information and resources.

4. **Federal funding** — Many Illinois state agencies receive federal grants. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that any organization receiving federal funding ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities.

5. **The April 2026 deadline is firm** — The U.S. Department of Justice's ADA Title II web accessibility rule (published April 24, 2024) requires state and local governments with populations of 50,000 or more to achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance by **April 24, 2026**. Illinois has over 12 million residents, so this deadline applies to all state agencies.

**The reality of digital accessibility now:**

Accessibility is no longer just "best practice" — it's the law. The 2026 deadline creates accountability for what has always been the right thing to do. For state agencies, this means integrating accessibility into every aspect of your digital presence: websites, documents, social media, and any tools you provide to the public.

**The good news:** Many accessibility improvements also benefit everyone — clearer content, better-organized documents, and more usable websites make information easier to find and understand for all users.

### If this has been a requirement, why hasn't your agency been doing this all along?

**Two things can be true at once:**

1. **Many agency web teams have been building accessible websites for years.** This isn’t “brand new” work for developers.
2. **The 2026 deadline changes who needs to participate.** Compliance now depends on _everyone who publishes digital content_, not just the web team.

**What the web team owns vs. what content teams own:**

- **Web team (website accessibility):** code structure, navigation, forms, keyboard support, ARIA where needed
- **Content creators (content accessibility):** accessible documents (Word/PDF/PowerPoint/Excel), image alt text, captions/transcripts, social media accessibility

**Why it feels different now:**

- **Accountability is stronger** — ADA Title II now points to a measurable standard (**WCAG 2.1 Level AA**) with a firm compliance deadline.
- **Scope is broader** — accessibility applies across websites _and_ documents, multimedia, social media, and third-party tools used to deliver services.

**The bottom line:** Developers can’t make your PDFs accessible for you, and they can’t caption your videos after the fact. The standard is the same, but the work is spread across roles — and the deadline makes that shared responsibility unavoidable.

### What happens after April 24, 2026?

**Quick answer:** After April 24, 2026, all public-facing digital content from state and local governments must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Agencies that don't comply risk DOJ investigations, lawsuits, legal costs, and — most importantly — excluding people with disabilities from accessing government services.

**Full explanation:**

**After April 24, 2026, state and local governments must be in compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for all public-facing digital content.** Agencies that fail to meet this deadline may face several potential issues:

**Legal and enforcement consequences:**

- **Department of Justice investigations** — The DOJ can investigate complaints and pursue enforcement actions against non-compliant agencies
- **Complaints and lawsuits** — Individuals with disabilities can file complaints with the DOJ or pursue private lawsuits under the ADA
- **Legal costs and remediation expenses** — Agencies may face significant costs for legal defense, settlements, and emergency remediation of inaccessible content
- **Reputational harm** — Public awareness of accessibility failures can damage an agency's reputation and public trust

**What this means for you personally:**

While enforcement is typically at the agency level, individuals may experience:

- **Required remediation** — You may be asked to fix inaccessible content you created
- **Mandatory training** — Staff who create inaccessible content may be required to complete accessibility training
- **Performance expectations** — Accessibility compliance may become part of job responsibilities and performance evaluations
- **Increased workload** — Emergency remediation is stressful and time-consuming; building accessibility in from the start prevents this

**Operational impacts:**

- **Service disruptions** — If complaints or lawsuits result in court orders, agencies may need to temporarily remove or restrict access to non-compliant content
- **Resource reallocation** — Emergency remediation efforts can divert staff time and budget from other priorities
- **Delayed projects** — New digital projects may be delayed while existing accessibility issues are addressed
- **Increased scrutiny** — Agencies with known accessibility issues may face increased oversight and reporting requirements

**The bottom line:** If it's digital and public-facing, it needs to be accessible by April 24, 2026. Agencies that start working toward compliance now have time to address issues systematically. Those that delay may face costly emergency remediation and legal consequences.

### What if we can't meet the April 24, 2026 deadline?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** The deadline is a legal requirement, not a target. If your agency can't achieve full compliance by April 24, 2026, you should still make as much progress as possible while documenting your remediation plan and prioritizing high-impact content.

**Full explanation:**

**The April 24, 2026 deadline is a firm legal requirement under the ADA Title II web accessibility rule.** The rule does not include a routine extension process, and non-compliance exposes agencies to enforcement actions, complaints, and lawsuits.

**However, the reality is that some agencies may not achieve 100% compliance by the deadline.** Here's what you should do:

**1. Prioritize ruthlessly:**

- Focus on high-traffic pages and documents first
- Address critical services that residents depend on
- Fix barriers that completely block access before cosmetic issues

**2. Document your remediation efforts:**

- Keep records of what you've fixed and when
- Maintain a prioritized backlog of remaining issues
- Show a clear timeline and plan for ongoing remediation

**3. Provide accessible alternatives:**

- If a document can't be remediated in time, provide an accessible alternative upon request
- Ensure contact information is available for accommodation requests
- Respond promptly to accessibility complaints

**4. Continue progress after the deadline:**

- The obligation doesn't end at the deadline — you must still work toward full compliance
- Demonstrating good-faith efforts matters if complaints are filed

**What NOT to do:**

- Don't use the deadline as an excuse to stop work — "we can't make it anyway" is not a defense
- Don't ignore accessibility because you're behind — some progress is always better than none
- Don't assume you won't be held accountable — enforcement is increasing

**The bottom line:** Missing the deadline is not a free pass. Agencies should make maximum progress, document their efforts, provide alternatives, and continue working toward full compliance. Good-faith efforts and documented progress can matter in enforcement contexts, but only if you're actually making progress.

### How do we prioritize accessibility work with limited resources and a ticking clock?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Start with the highest-impact content — what the most people need, for the most critical services. Don't try to fix everything at once; focus on removing the biggest barriers first.

**Full explanation:**

**When time and resources are limited, strategic prioritization is essential.** Here's a practical framework agencies like yours can use:

**Tier 1: Fix First (Highest Impact)**

- **Critical services** — Applications, forms, and information people need to access benefits, report issues, or meet legal requirements
- **High-traffic pages** — Your homepage, main navigation, and most-visited content
- **Complete blockers** — Issues that prevent access entirely (missing form labels, inaccessible login, no keyboard navigation)
- **New content** — Stop creating new barriers; make all new content accessible immediately

**Tier 2: Fix Next (High Impact)**

- **Frequently used documents** — Annual reports, guides, forms that get regular downloads
- **Video content** — Add captions to videos, starting with the most viewed
- **Third-party tools** — Audit embedded tools and widgets; request VPATs and remediation timelines

**Tier 3: Fix Systematically (Ongoing)**

- **Archive content** — Older documents and pages with lower traffic
- **Social media backlog** — Historical posts (new posts should be accessible from now on)
- **Comprehensive remediation** — Work through remaining issues methodically

**Practical steps to get started:**

1. **Audit your content inventory** — Know what you have (pages, documents, videos, tools)
2. **Identify your top 20** — Focus on the 20 highest-priority items first
3. **Stop the bleeding** — Require accessibility for all new content immediately
4. **Track progress** — Document what you've fixed and what remains
5. **Allocate time weekly** — Even 2-4 hours/week of focused remediation adds up

**Example prioritization (real agency scenario):**

A state agency with limited resources might prioritize like this:

- **Week 1-2:** Homepage and main navigation (highest traffic)
- **Week 3-4:** Online application forms (critical services)
- **Month 2:** Top 10 most-downloaded PDFs (frequently used documents)
- **Month 3:** Video captions for training materials (high-impact multimedia)
- **Ongoing:** All new content created accessibly, archive content as time permits

**What agencies like yours actually do:**

- Assign accessibility responsibilities to specific staff
- Include accessibility in project timelines and content workflows
- Use automated testing (WAVE, axe) for quick wins
- Request vendor accessibility documentation before purchasing
- Celebrate progress — fixing 50% is better than fixing 0%

**The bottom line:** You don't have to fix everything at once, but you do have to start. Prioritize by impact, document your plan, and make steady progress. The goal is to remove as many barriers as possible for as many people as possible by the deadline.

### What's the bare minimum we need to do by April 2026?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** There's no official "minimum" — the law requires full WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. But if you're overwhelmed, here's a pragmatic prioritization: stop creating new barriers immediately, fix the highest-impact issues first, and have a documented plan for the rest.

**Full explanation:**

**Legally, there is no "minimum."** The requirement is full compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA for all public-facing digital content. However, we understand that 100% compliance by the deadline may not be realistic for everyone.

**Here's what "minimum viable compliance" looks like in practice:**

**1. STOP creating new barriers (effective immediately):**

- All new documents use heading styles and alt text
- All new videos have captions
- All new web content is keyboard-accessible
- All new purchases include WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements in contracts

**2. FIX the biggest barriers first:**

- Homepage and main navigation
- Forms and applications (anything people need to access services)
- Top 20 most-visited pages
- Top 20 most-downloaded documents
- Any content that completely blocks access (e.g., missing form labels, no keyboard navigation)

**3. DOCUMENT your remediation plan:**

- Inventory of what exists
- Prioritized list of what needs fixing
- Timeline with milestones
- Who's responsible for what
- Process for responding to accessibility complaints

**4. RESPOND to requests:**

- Have a process to provide accessible alternatives upon request
- Post contact information for accessibility issues
- Track and respond to complaints promptly

**What you cannot skip:**

- New content must be accessible — no exceptions
- High-impact public services must be accessible
- You must provide accessible alternatives when someone asks

**What can wait (if you have to triage):**

- Archived content not currently used
- Low-traffic pages with minimal public impact
- Historical social media posts

**Example "bare minimum" approach (realistic scenario):**

A small state agency with 5 staff and 200+ documents might:

- **Immediately:** Require all new content to be accessible (stop the bleeding)
- **Month 1:** Fix homepage, main navigation, and top 3 application forms
- **Month 2-3:** Remediate top 10 most-downloaded PDFs
- **Month 4-6:** Add captions to all training videos
- **Ongoing:** Document remaining issues, provide accessible alternatives upon request, continue remediation

**The bottom line:** The legal requirement is full compliance, and "we only did the minimum" won't protect you from complaints about content you didn't fix. But strategic prioritization — documented and actively progressing — is far better than paralysis. Start with the biggest barriers, stop creating new ones, and keep moving.

## Legal Requirements (IITAA and ADA Title II)

### What is the IITAA?

**The IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** requires Illinois agencies and universities to ensure that their websites, information systems, and information technologies are accessible to people with disabilities. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 24, 2024) require conformance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official IITAA page:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html</a>

### Who must comply with the IITAA?

The IITAA applies to:

- Executive, legislative, and judicial branches of Illinois state government
- All state departments, divisions, and agencies
- Constitutional offices
- Public universities

The IITAA does **not** directly apply to:

- Local governments
- School districts
- Community colleges
- Private organizations

**Note:** Local governments and school districts still have obligations under ADA Title II.

### What does the IITAA cover?

The IITAA covers all "information and communication technology," including:

- Websites and web applications
- Software and desktop applications
- Mobile applications
- Electronic documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Multimedia (video and audio)
- Information kiosks
- Hardware with user interfaces

### When did the current IITAA standards take effect?

- **IITAA 1.0** — August 20, 2008 (original standards)
- **IITAA 2.0** — January 18, 2018 (aligned with WCAG 2.0 AA)
- **IITAA 2.1** — June 24, 2024 (aligned with WCAG 2.1 Level AA)

### Where can I get IITAA training?

The Illinois Department of Innovation & Technology (DoIT) Office of Information Accessibility provides free training for state agencies, including:

- Introduction to Accessibility (2-hour overview)

- TTY: 866-277-5669

### What is the ADA Title II web accessibility rule?

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule establishing specific technical requirements for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rule requires state and local governments to make their public-facing digital content meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official fact sheet:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>

### How does Title II differ from Title I? I'm familiar with Title I, but Title II is new to me.

**Quick answer:** **Title I** covers **employment** and reasonable accommodations for employees. **Title II** covers **public services** and requires state and local governments to proactively make public-facing digital content meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** by the compliance deadline.

**The key difference:** Title I is about **individual workplace accommodations**. Title II is about **equitable public access** to government services — including digital services — using a **measurable standard** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).

**Title I (Employment):**

- Focus: employees and job applicants
- Approach: reasonable accommodations, case-by-case (interactive process)
- “Standard”: no single technical web standard required — it’s about reasonable access in context

**Examples:** accessible internal documents when needed; assistive tech software; modified equipment.

**Title II (Public Services):**

- Focus: programs/services offered to the public
- Approach: proactive accessibility for everyone (not just when requested)
- Standard: **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** for public-facing web content and mobile apps (per the 2024 web rule)

**Examples:** accessible websites/forms; accessible PDFs; captions for videos; accessible third‑party tools used to deliver services.

**Key differences (at a glance):**

| Aspect                  | Title I (Employment)                                          | Title II (Public Services)                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Who it applies to**   | Employers (private and public)                                | State and local governments                    |
| **What it covers**      | Employment practices and workplace accommodations             | Public programs, services, and activities      |
| **Approach**            | Case-by-case reasonable accommodations                        | Proactive accessibility for all public content |
| **Technical standards** | No specific standards; accommodations determined individually | WCAG 2.1 Level AA required                     |
| **Timeline**            | Accommodations provided when requested                        | Must be compliant by April 2026 deadline       |
| **Scope**               | Individual employee needs                                     | All public-facing digital content              |
| **Internal vs. public** | Primarily internal (workplace)                                | Primarily public-facing content                |

**Why it can feel “new”:** The **web rule is recent (April 2024)** — it’s the first time DOJ set a specific digital standard under Title II.

**For Illinois state agencies:** You must do both — **Title I** for employees and **Title II** for the public.

**The bottom line:** Title I is about employment accommodations (what you're familiar with), while Title II is about making public services accessible to everyone (what the 2026 deadline addresses). The April 2024 web rule is the first time Title II has had specific technical standards for digital content, which is why it may feel new even though Title II itself has existed since 1990.

### When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?

| Entity Size                                    | Compliance Deadline |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Entities serving populations of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Entities serving populations under 50,000      | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026** (since Illinois has over 12 million residents).

### Does ADA Title II apply to internal documents?

**No, the ADA Title II web rule does not directly apply to purely internal content.** The rule specifically covers "services, programs, and activities provided or made available" to the public.

**However**, internal content may still need to be accessible under:

- **ADA Title I** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which could include making internal systems accessible
- **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities
- **IITAA** — Illinois law covers intranets and internal systems used by state employees

**Best practice:** Make internal documents accessible proactively. It's easier than retrofitting later, and you may have employees with disabilities who need access.

### Are there any exceptions to the ADA Title II rule?

Yes, limited exceptions exist for:

1. **Archived content** — Content created before the compliance date that is not currently used for services
2. **Pre-existing conventional electronic documents** — Documents created before the compliance date, **unless** currently used by the public to participate in or benefit from the entity's services, programs, or activities
3. **Third-party content** — Content posted by third parties not under contract
4. **Password-protected individual documents** — Documents specific to one person's account
5. **Pre-existing social media posts** — Posts made before the compliance deadline

**Important:** Even when exceptions apply, you may still need to provide accessible alternatives upon request.

## Website Accessibility

### How do I test my website for accessibility?

**Why this matters:** Automated tools catch many issues quickly, but they can't detect everything. Manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers reveals barriers that automated tools miss — and these barriers can prevent people with disabilities from using your website entirely.

Use a combination of automated and manual testing:

**Automated Testing Tools (free):**

- **WAVE** — <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wave.webaim.org/</a> (browser extension)
- **axe DevTools** — <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.deque.com/axe/</a> (browser extension)
- **ANDI** — <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html</a> (bookmarklet)
- **Lighthouse** — Built into Chrome DevTools

**Manual Testing:**

- Keyboard navigation — Can you access everything without a mouse?
- Screen reader testing — Does content make sense when read aloud?
- Zoom and reflow testing — Does content remain usable at 200% zoom? At 400% zoom (or 320px viewport width), does content reflow without requiring horizontal scrolling?
- Color contrast — Is text readable against its background?

1. **Missing or inadequate alt text** for images
2. **Poor color contrast** between text and background
3. **Missing form labels** — form fields without associated labels
4. **Keyboard inaccessibility** — interactive elements that can't be reached or operated with a keyboard
5. **Missing or improper heading structure** — headings used for styling rather than structure
6. **Missing captions or transcripts** for video/audio content
7. **Links that don't make sense out of context** — "click here" or "read more"
8. **Missing page titles** or duplicate titles across pages
9. **Tables without proper headers** — data tables lacking row/column headers
10. **Auto-playing media** without controls

### What color contrast ratio is required?

For WCAG 2.1 Level AA:

- **Normal text** (smaller than 18pt/~24px regular or 14pt/~19px bold): **4.5:1** contrast ratio
- **Large text** (18pt/~24px+ regular or 14pt/~19px+ bold): **3:1** contrast ratio
- **UI components and graphics**: **3:1** contrast ratio (for interactive elements, icons, and graphical objects required to understand content - WCAG SC 1.4.11)

### Do I need to caption all videos?

Yes, for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance:

- **Pre-recorded video with audio** — Requires synchronized captions
- **Live video with audio** — Requires live captions (accuracy matters; auto-captions may need human support)
- **Pre-recorded audio only** — Requires a text transcript
- **Video with essential visual content** — Requires audio description at Level AA **only if** important visual information isn't already conveyed in the existing audio track. For example, a video where a speaker says 'as you can see on this chart...' without describing the chart would need audio description. A talking-head video where the speaker fully explains their points verbally typically does not.

### How do I make mobile apps accessible?

**Quick answer:** Mobile apps must meet the same WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as websites. This includes proper labeling, keyboard/gesture navigation, sufficient color contrast, and compatibility with mobile screen readers (VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android).

**Full explanation:**

Mobile apps provided to the public by state and local governments must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards under the ADA Title II web rule. Mobile accessibility follows the same principles as web accessibility, but with platform-specific considerations.

**Core mobile accessibility requirements:**

1. **Screen reader compatibility** — Apps must work with:
   - **iOS:** VoiceOver (built-in)
   - **Android:** TalkBack (built-in)
   - Content must be properly labeled and navigable

2. **Touch target size** — While WCAG 2.1 Level AA doesn't mandate specific sizes, platform guidelines recommend at least 44x44 points (iOS) or 48x48 density-independent pixels (Android) for usability. This is considered essential best practice for users with motor disabilities.

3. **Color contrast** — Same 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text as web content

4. **Alternative input methods** — Support for:
   - External keyboards
   - Switch control devices
   - Voice control

5. **Dynamic content** — Announce updates to screen readers (e.g., form validation, loading states)

**Platform-specific guidance:**

**iOS (Apple):**

- Use native accessibility APIs (UIAccessibility)
- Test with VoiceOver (Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver)
- Use semantic labels (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`)
- Support Dynamic Type for text scaling
- Ensure proper focus management

**Android:**

- Use Android Accessibility APIs
- Test with TalkBack (Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack)
- Use content descriptions for images and icons
- Support font scaling
- Implement proper focus indicators

**Step-by-step mobile app accessibility workflow:**

1. **Design phase:**
   - Aim for touch targets of at least 44x44 points (strong usability best practice)
   - Design with sufficient color contrast
   - Plan for text scaling (support Dynamic Type/Large Text)
   - Avoid relying solely on color to convey information

2. **Development phase:**
   - Use native accessibility APIs (don't build custom solutions)
   - Add accessibility labels to all interactive elements
   - Test with screen readers during development (not just at the end)
   - Implement proper focus management

3. **Testing phase:**
   - Test with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
   - Test with keyboard navigation (external keyboard)
   - Test with text scaling enabled
   - Test with color contrast checkers
   - Use automated tools (axe DevTools Mobile, Accessibility Scanner for Android)

4. **Before release:**
   - Complete accessibility audit
   - Document known issues and remediation plan
   - Test with real users with disabilities if possible

**Common mobile accessibility mistakes:**

- **Too-small touch targets** — Buttons or links that are hard to tap
- **Missing labels** — Icons without text descriptions
- **Poor focus management** — Focus gets lost or trapped
- **Inaccessible gestures** — Complex swipe patterns that can't be performed with assistive technology
- **No keyboard support** — App doesn't work with external keyboards

### What about third-party widgets, embedded content, dashboards, and maps?

**Yes.** You are responsible for the accessibility of third-party content that you embed or integrate into your website through contracts or agreements. This includes:

- Payment processors, scheduling tools, chat widgets
- Embedded maps (like ArcGIS) and dashboards (like Tableau)
- Social media feeds, survey tools
- Learning management systems (LMS), document signing tools (like DocuSign), and other third-party services

**Minimum requirements (what "accessible" means):**

- Works **with keyboard only** (no mouse required)
- Works with a **screen reader** (labels, controls, and structure make sense)
- Meets **contrast** requirements and has visible focus

**What to do:**

1. **Request accessibility documentation** (VPAT/ACR) from vendors before purchasing
2. **Include accessibility requirements in contracts** (require WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
3. **Test the workflow** using keyboard navigation, screen reader, and automated checkers (see: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do))
4. **Provide an accessible alternative** if the tool can't be made accessible:
   - **Dashboards/maps:** accessible data tables/CSV downloads + plain-language summaries
   - **Maps:** accessible lists/tables of locations + text explanation of what the map shows
   - **Other tools:** equivalent accessible methods to complete the same service

**For specific tools:** See questions below about [DocuSign](#our-agency-uses-docusign-to-digitally-sign-documen), [LMS systems](#is-a-learning-management-system-lms-like-docebo-wc), and [existing content like Tableau or ArcGIS](#if-we-have-existing-content-like-tableau-dashboard).

**Reference:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a> (see section on "Third-Party Content Provided Through Contracts or Agreements")

### Does our agency's password-protected intranet need to be accessible?

**Quick answer:** Password-protected intranet sites for employees only are generally exempt from ADA Title II, but **may still need to be accessible under Illinois state law (IITAA), ADA Title I (employment), and Section 504** (federal funding). Always prioritize employee accommodations if requested.

**Full explanation:**

**It depends.** Password-protected intranet sites that are **only accessible to agency employees** (not the public) are generally **exempt from the ADA Title II web rule**, but they may still need to be accessible under other laws.

**ADA Title II exemption:**

The ADA Title II web rule specifically covers content "provided or made available to the public." Password-protected intranet sites that are:

- Only accessible to agency employees
- Not accessible to the general public
- Protected by authentication (login required)

...are generally **exempt from ADA Title II WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements**.

**However, other legal requirements may still apply:**

1. **IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** — Illinois state law requires that intranets and internal systems used by state employees be accessible
2. **ADA Title I (Employment)** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. If an employee needs to access the intranet to do their job, it may need to be accessible
3. **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities

**Best practice:** Make your intranet accessible proactively. It supports employees with disabilities, prevents costly retrofitting, and ensures compliance with IITAA.

**Resources:**

- **IITAA Requirements:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html</a>
- **ADA Title I (Employment):** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/</a>

### What about archived documents on the intranet?

**Quick answer:** Truly archived documents that are no longer used may be exempt, but you must still provide accessible alternatives **upon request** if an employee needs them.

**Full explanation:**

**Archived documents that are not currently used may be exempt** — but you must still provide accessible alternatives **upon request**.

**For truly archived documents:**

- Historical records not currently referenced
- Old versions replaced by newer documents
- Content no longer needed for business operations

**Exception:** Even archived documents should be made accessible if they're:

- Referenced or linked from active intranet pages
- Part of a searchable document library
- Needed for reference or historical context

**If an employee requests access to archived content, you must provide an accessible version.**

### After April 2026, do all new documents need to be accessible?

**Quick answer:** Yes. All new documents created or published after April 24, 2026 must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards from day one — whether posted publicly or on an intranet.

**Full explanation:**

**Yes. All new documents created after the April 24, 2026 deadline must be accessible** — whether they're posted publicly or on an intranet.

**For new documents (created after April 24, 2026):**

- **Yes** — All new documents (PDFs, Excel, Word, PowerPoint) must be accessible
- Make accessibility part of your document creation workflow
- This includes documents created internally or received from external sources

**For existing documents (created before April 24, 2026):**

- **Prioritize by usage** — Focus on:
  - Documents actively used by employees or the public
  - Frequently accessed documents
  - Documents required for services or job functions
  - Documents linked from main pages
- **Archived documents** — May remain as-is unless someone requests access, at which point you must provide an accessible version

**Key principle:** The requirement is to ensure people with disabilities can access the information they need. If a document is truly archived and never accessed, it may not need immediate remediation. But if anyone needs it, you must provide an accessible version.

**Best practices:**

1. **Create an accessibility workflow** — Make all new documents accessible before posting
2. **Prioritize remediation** — Focus on frequently used existing documents
3. **Respond to requests** — Have a process to quickly provide accessible versions of archived documents upon request
4. **Document your efforts** — Keep records of what's accessible, what needs work, and any requests you've fulfilled

### How do I test third-party tool compliance? What do I do to verify (for example, Docebo or DocuSign) compliance?

**Why this matters:** Vendor claims about accessibility aren't always accurate, and even accessible platforms can become inaccessible through custom configuration or content you add. Testing real workflows ensures the tools your agency uses actually work for people with disabilities — not just in theory, but in practice.

**Quick answer:** Don't rely on vendor claims. Request a current VPAT, then test your **real workflows** with (1) keyboard-only navigation, (2) a screen reader, and (3) an automated checker (axe/WAVE). Document issues and require fixes (or an accessible alternative) before you go live.

**Minimum test plan (30–60 minutes):**

1. **Pick 2–3 real workflows** (example: “sign a document,” “enroll and complete a course,” “submit a form”).
2. **Run an automated scan** (axe DevTools or WAVE) on each workflow screen:
   - **axe DevTools** — <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.deque.com/axe/</a>
   - **WAVE** — <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wave.webaim.org/</a>
3. **Keyboard-only check** (no mouse):
   - You can reach everything (Tab/Shift+Tab) and activate it (Enter/Space)
   - Focus is visible and never gets “stuck”
4. **Screen reader spot-check** (at least one):
   - **NVDA** (free) — <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nvaccess.org/</a>
   - **VoiceOver** (built-in on Mac/iOS)
   - Confirm labels make sense, errors are announced, and the workflow can be completed
5. **Document what you found**:
   - Date/version tested, workflow steps, issues, and screenshots
   - “Workaround/alternative provided” if the vendor can’t fix quickly

**Procurement/contract expectations (what to ask for):**

- **VPAT/ACR** for the exact product/version you’re buying/using
- A list of **known issues** + vendor **remediation timeline**
- Contract language requiring **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** and support for accessibility fixes

**Ongoing monitoring (keep it lightweight):**

- Re-test after **major updates**, configuration/theme changes, or new integrations
- Track user feedback and escalate issues to the vendor

**Resources:**

- DoIT Testing Resources: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html</a>
- Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline: <a href="https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/</a>

**The bottom line:** Test the workflows people actually use. If the tool can’t be made accessible quickly, you still need to provide an **accessible alternative** for the service.

### Our agency uses DocuSign to digitally sign documents. Is this something that falls under WCAG compliance?

**Quick answer:** Yes. If you use DocuSign for public-facing services, the **signing workflow** and the **documents you send** must be accessible.

**What to do (in order):**

1. **Make the documents accessible first** (Word/PDF before upload). DocuSign can’t “fix” an inaccessible document.
2. **Request DocuSign’s current VPAT/ACR** for your version and configuration.
3. **Test the real signing workflow** using the steps in: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do)
4. **Have an accessible alternative** if a user can’t complete the signing process (example: an accessible PDF form + supported return method, in-person or assisted signing).

**The bottom line:** Your agency is responsible for accessibility for services delivered through DocuSign. Start with accessible documents, verify the workflow, and keep a backup method ready.

### Is a Learning Management System (LMS) like Docebo WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant?

**Quick answer:** Sometimes partially. Even if the LMS platform is improving, **your course content and configuration still have to be accessible**.

**What can affect LMS accessibility:**

- Platform version/configuration
- Custom themes/branding
- Plugins/integrations
- Specific feature limitations (quizzes, embedded media, uploads, etc.)

**Accessible LMS course checklist (high impact):**

1. **Documents** — Upload accessible Word/PDF/PowerPoint files (make the source accessible first).
2. **Video/audio** — Captions for video; transcripts for audio; fix auto-captions.
3. **Images** — Alt text for images/graphics; don’t put essential text only in images.
4. **Structure** — Clear headings and descriptive link text; predictable navigation and module names.
5. **Interactivity** — Quizzes/forms are keyboard accessible, with clear labels and error messages.
6. **Color** — Sufficient contrast and no “color-only” meaning.
7. **Test the course** using: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do)

**Resources:**

- WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference (Level AA): <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa</a>
- WebAIM Contrast Checker: <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>

**The bottom line:** Treat the LMS like any other third-party tool: verify the platform, and ensure the content you upload is accessible.

### If we have existing content like Tableau dashboards, ArcGIS maps, or Docebo online courses, do those fall into the exemption category? Or do they need to be made immediately accessible?

**Quick answer:** If it's **currently used to provide public services**, it needs to be accessible (no "archived content" exemption). If it’s **truly archived and not used**, it may be exempt — but you still must provide an accessible alternative **upon request**.

**The key distinction:**

- **Currently used for services** = Must be accessible
- **Archived/not currently used** = May be exempt, but must provide accessible alternatives upon request

**What to do (works for dashboards, maps, and courses):**

1. **Inventory** what exists and label it **active** vs. **archived**
2. **Prioritize** by impact (high-traffic, high-stakes, frequently used)
3. **Make it accessible or provide an equivalent accessible alternative**, such as:
   - **Dashboards/maps:** accessible data tables/CSV downloads + plain-language summaries
   - **Courses:** accessible documents + captions/transcripts + accessible quiz interactions
4. **Test** using the workflow approach in: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do)
5. **Document** what you changed, what remains, and the alternatives you provide

**Tool-specific notes (common pain points):**

- **Tableau**: interactive charts often need **accessible tables** and clear descriptions. Don’t rely on hover-only tooltips.
- **ArcGIS**: complex interactive maps frequently need **equivalent text + data** (tables, lists of locations, and a written summary of what the map shows).
- **Docebo/LMS courses**: the platform may be “mostly accessible,” but **uploaded content and course design** are where failures usually occur (captions, docs, images, quizzes, navigation).

**Resources:**

- ADA Title II Web Rule: <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>
- DoIT Accessibility Guidance: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html</a>

**The bottom line:** If the public needs it to access a service, it must be accessible. If you can’t make the tool fully accessible quickly, provide an **equivalent accessible alternative** and document the remediation plan.

## Content Accessibility (Documents, PDFs, Presentations)

### My documents look fine — why do they need to be "accessible"?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** "Looking fine" means you can see the content visually. "Accessible" means people using screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other assistive technologies can also use the content — and that requires specific structure that's invisible to you but essential for them.

**Full explanation:**

When you create a document, you see formatted text, images, and layout. But someone using a screen reader experiences the document very differently — they hear it read aloud, navigate by headings, and rely on text descriptions of images. If those structural elements aren't there, the document is unusable for them.

**What "accessible" actually means (it's more than alt text):**

| What you see                               | What accessibility requires                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bold, large text that looks like a heading | Proper heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2) so screen readers can navigate |
| A nice-looking table                       | Header rows defined so screen readers announce column names                 |
| An image or chart                          | Alt text describing what's in the image                                     |
| A clickable link                           | Descriptive link text (not "click here")                                    |
| A form to fill out                         | Properly labeled form fields                                                |
| Good-looking colors                        | Sufficient contrast (4.5:1 ratio for text)                                  |

**Why this matters:**

- **Screen readers can't "see"** — they read the document's underlying structure, not its visual appearance
- **Keyboard users can't click** — they navigate using Tab and arrow keys, which require proper structure
- **Users with low vision may zoom 200%+** — the document must reflow properly
- **Users with cognitive disabilities** — benefit from clear headings, simple language, and logical organization

**The good news:** Making documents accessible usually makes them better organized and easier to use for everyone.

**Quick test:** Open your document and try navigating it using only the keyboard (Tab, arrow keys, Enter). If you can't reach everything or don't know where you are, it's not accessible.

**Learn more:** See the specific questions below for Word, PDF, Excel, and PowerPoint accessibility.

### What about photos your agency takes at events — like speeches or awards ceremonies? Do those need to be accessible?

**Yes, if you're sharing them digitally.** Any photos published on your agency's website, social media, or in digital documents need alt text (alternative text) that describes the image for people who can't see it.

**What is alt text?**

Alt text is a brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who are blind or have low vision. It's also displayed if an image fails to load.

**How to write good alt text for event photos:**

- **Be specific and concise** — Describe what's actually happening in the photo
- **Include relevant names** — If someone is being recognized, name them
- **Describe the context** — What event is this? What's the setting?
- **Keep it brief** — Usually 1-2 sentences is sufficient

**Examples:**

| Photo Type     | Poor Alt Text             | Good Alt Text                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Award ceremony | "Photo" or "IMG_4523.jpg" | "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe at the annual agency awards ceremony" |
| Speech         | "Person speaking"         | "Agency director addresses attendees at the 2025 victim services conference"                                      |
| Group photo    | "Group of people"         | "Agency research team staff at the December 2025 all-hands meeting"                                               |
| Event venue    | "Conference room"         | "Attendees networking during a break at the Illinois Criminal Justice Summit"                                     |

**Where to add alt text:**

- **Website/CMS** — Look for the "alt text" or "image description" field when uploading
- **Word documents** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **PowerPoint** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **Social media** — Each platform has an alt text option (see Social Media Accessibility section)
- **Email** — Outlook and Gmail both support alt text for images

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A</a> — All non-text content must have a text alternative

### How long should alt text be?

**Best practice: Keep alt text concise—aim for 1-2 sentences in most cases.** The commonly cited "125 character limit" isn't a technical requirement (modern screen readers handle longer text just fine), but brevity helps users process information quickly.

- **Ideal:** Concise and scannable (roughly 15-25 words)
- **Acceptable:** Longer alt text when the image requires detailed description
- **Too short:** Single words like "photo" or "image" don't help anyone
- **Consider alternatives:** If you need extensive description (charts, infographics, diagrams), use a visible caption, long description, or linked text instead of cramming everything into alt text

**The key principle:** Alt text should be **concise but complete**. Describe what's meaningful about the image in as few words as necessary — but don't sacrifice clarity just to hit an arbitrary character limit.

**The bottom line:** If you took the photo because it captures something meaningful, that meaning needs to be conveyed in alt text for people who can't see it. Keep it concise when possible, but don't truncate important information just to stay under 125 characters — modern screen readers can handle more.

### How do I handle complex images like charts, graphs, or infographics?

Some images — like charts, graphs, infographics, or images containing lots of text — need more than a brief alt text. Here's how to handle them:

**For charts and graphs with data:**

1. **Alt text:** Provide a brief summary of what the chart shows (e.g., "Bar chart showing Illinois crime rates declining 15% from 2020 to 2024")
2. **Data table:** Include the underlying data in an accessible table format, either directly below the chart or linked nearby
3. **Long description:** If the trends or patterns matter, describe them in the body text

**Example for a chart:**

- **Alt text:** "Line graph showing agency grant funding from 2020-2025. Full data in table below."
- **Below the image:** An accessible HTML table with the actual numbers

**For infographics or images with lots of text:**

1. **Don't use images of text** — If possible, present the information as actual text on the page instead of as an image
2. **If you must use an image:** Provide the full text content in one of these ways:
   - A "long description" link that opens the full text
   - An expandable section below the image with the complete text
   - A text summary in the body of the page

**For scanned documents or PDF images:**

1. **Best approach:** Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the image to actual text
2. **If OCR isn't possible:** Provide a text transcript of the document content
3. **Alt text:** Describe what the document is (e.g., "Scanned letter from Governor dated June 2025. Full transcript below.")

**General rule for complex images:**

- **Alt text:** Brief summary + tell users where to find more detail
- **Long description:** Provide full information in accessible text format nearby or linked

**Example patterns:**

| Image Type       | Alt Text Approach                                     | Additional Requirement    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data chart       | "Chart showing [brief conclusion]. Data table below." | Accessible data table     |
| Infographic      | "Infographic about [topic]. Full text follows."       | Complete text version     |
| Scanned document | "[Document type] from [source]. Transcript provided." | Text transcript           |
| Complex diagram  | "Diagram of [subject]. Described in detail below."    | Detailed text description |

### How do I make images accessible on social media, Constant Contact, or Canva?

Sharing infographics, charts, or images with text on platforms like social media, Constant Contact, or Canva presents unique challenges because you often can't add data tables or long descriptions directly.

**Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn):**

- **Alt text limits vary** — Most platforms allow 100-1000 characters for alt text, but keep it concise
- **Use the post text** — Put key information in the post caption itself, not just the image
- **Link to more** — If sharing a complex infographic, link to a webpage with the full accessible version
- **Don't rely on the image alone** — If the image contains important text or data, repeat it in your post

**Example social media approach:**

- **Image:** Infographic showing "5 Steps to Accessible Documents"
- **Alt text:** "Infographic listing 5 steps to create accessible documents. Steps listed in post."
- **Post text:** "Here are 5 steps to accessible documents: 1) Use heading styles, 2) Add alt text to images, 3) Use meaningful link text, 4) Check color contrast, 5) Run accessibility checker. Full guide: [link]"

**Constant Contact and email marketing:**

- **Alt text field:** Constant Contact has an alt text field for images — use it
- **Character limit:** Keep alt text brief since email clients vary in support
- **Avoid image-only emails** — Don't put critical information only in images; many users have images disabled by default
- **Provide text version** — Key messages should appear as actual text in the email, not just in graphics

**Example email approach:**

- **Image:** Event announcement graphic with date, time, location
- **Alt text:** "Agency training event - details in text below"
- **Email body:** Include all event details as actual text below the image

**Canva:**

- **Canva supports alt text** — When you download or share, Canva can include alt text
- **Better approach:** Export important text content separately, not just as an image
- **For presentations:** Use Canva's presentation mode which supports alt text, or export to PowerPoint and add alt text there
- **For print vs. digital:** If creating something for digital distribution, consider whether it needs to be an image at all

**General rule for social/email:**

If you're sharing a complex image on social media or email, ask yourself: "If someone can't see this image, can they still get the information?" If not, you need to provide the content as text — either in the post/email body or linked to an accessible page.

### Who should write the alt text for photos?

**Ideally, the person supplying the photo should also supply the alt text.** They know what's happening in the image, who's pictured, and why it matters. If you're submitting photos for the website, a newsletter, or social media, include alt text with your submission.

- **You were there** — You know the context, the names, and what made the moment significant
- **You chose the photo** — You selected it for a reason; that reason should be in the alt text
- **It saves time** — The web team or communications staff shouldn't have to guess who's in the photo or what event it's from

**Best practice:** When submitting photos, include a simple list: "Photo 1: [alt text], Photo 2: [alt text]" etc.

### Are captions the same as alt text?

**No — captions and alt text serve different purposes and both may be needed.**

|                 | Caption                                              | Alt Text                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visibility**  | Visible to everyone on the page                      | Hidden; only read by screen readers or shown if image fails to load |
| **Purpose**     | Provides context, credits, or additional information | Describes the image for people who can't see it                     |
| **Who sees it** | All users                                            | Users with screen readers, or when images don't load                |
| **Required?**   | Optional but often helpful                           | Required for accessibility                                          |

**Example of both working together:**

- **Alt text:** "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe"
- **Caption:** "Officer John Doe receives the 2025 Excellence Award for his work on community violence intervention programs. Photo: Agency"

The alt text describes what's visually happening. The caption adds context that all readers benefit from (what the award was for, photo credit).

**When you might skip detailed alt text:**

- **Purely decorative images** — If a photo adds no meaningful information (like a decorative border), mark it as decorative. But event photos are almost never purely decorative.
- **Caption already describes it** — If there's a visible caption that fully describes the visual content, alt text can be briefer — but alt text is still required (even if just "Award ceremony as described in caption").

### Do all documents need to be accessible?

For public-facing documents, yes. Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, conventional electronic documents must be accessible, including:

**DoIT best practice:** Before creating a document (especially a PDF), consider whether the content could be published as webpage text instead. Illinois DoIT generally recommends publishing content as webpage text when feasible instead of relying on PDFs. In practice, HTML webpage text is often easier to make and keep accessible than PDFs—especially when the alternative is a short webpage summary that links to a PDF that may or may not be accessible. This DoIT best practice aligns with WCAG 2.1 Level AA rules and ADA Title II requirements. If you must use a document format, ensure it's accessible.

- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations

**Exceptions may apply for:**

- Pre-existing documents not currently used for services (still must provide accessible alternatives upon request)
- Password-protected documents specific to an individual's account

### How do I make a Word document accessible?

Where do I start?](#im-a-content-creator-where-do-i-start) | [My documents look fine — why do they need to be "accessible"?](#my-documents-look-fine--why-do-they-need-to-be-accessible) | [Do all documents need to be accessible?](#do-all-documents-need-to-be-accessible)

**Step-by-step workflow for creating an accessible Word document:**

**Before you start:**

1. Use an accessible template if available (check with your agency's accessibility coordinator)
2. Plan your document structure (main heading, sections, subsections)

**During creation:**

1. **Set up document language** — File > Options > Language > Set as default
2. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
   - _Visual example:_ Instead of making text 18pt and bold, use the "Heading 1" style from the Styles pane
   - _Why:_ Screen readers use heading styles to navigate; bold text doesn't create navigation structure
3. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
   - _Visual example:_ For a photo of a meeting, alt text might be "Five people sitting around a conference table discussing a document"
   - _Why:_ Screen readers read alt text aloud; without it, images are invisible to users who can't see them
4. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
   - _Visual example:_ Use Table Tools > Design > Header Row checkbox to mark the first row as headers
   - _Why:_ Screen readers announce column headers when navigating table cells
5. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
   - _Visual example:_ "Download the 2025 Annual Report" instead of "Click here"
   - _Why:_ Screen readers can list all links on a page; "click here" provides no context
6. **Ensure sufficient color contrast** — Use the Accessibility Checker to identify contrast issues
7. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon (not manually typed dashes or numbers)
   - _Visual example:_ Use the bullet list button, not typing "-" before each item
   - _Why:_ Screen readers announce list structure and item count

**Before publishing:**

8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility
   - Fix all errors (red X)
   - Review warnings (yellow triangle)
   - Address tips (blue circle) when possible
9. **Test with a screen reader** — If available, use Narrator (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac) to verify the document makes sense when read aloud
10. **Save as accessible PDF** — If converting to PDF, use File > Save As > PDF, then check "Best for electronic distribution and accessibility"

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- Using text boxes for content (screen readers may skip them)
- Using watermarks that interfere with readability
- Embedding essential information only in headers/footers
- Using decorative fonts that are hard to read

Key steps for accessible Word documents:

1. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
2. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click > Edit Alt Text
3. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
4. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**
6. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon
7. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

The best approach depends on the source:

**If you have the source document (Word, InDesign, etc.):**

1. Make the source document accessible first
2. Export to PDF with accessibility settings enabled
3. Check and fix any remaining issues in Adobe Acrobat Pro

**If you only have the PDF:**

1. Run the Accessibility Checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro
2. Add tags using the Reading Order tool
3. Add alt text to images
4. Set the document language
5. Verify reading order
6. Test with a screen reader

### Is Canva accessible?

**Canva has made significant progress on accessibility** and offers several helpful features:

**What Canva does well:**

- **Design Accessibility checker** — Checks contrast, alt text, and typography
- **Automatic alt text suggestions** — AI-powered suggestions for image descriptions
- **Reading order and heading tagging** — Better structure for PDFs
- **Easier for non-designers** — More accessible than learning Adobe InDesign

**Important limitation:** Canva PDFs are not fully WCAG or PDF/UA compliant out of the box.

**Best practices for using Canva:**

1. **Use the Design Accessibility tool before exporting** — It will catch many issues
2. **Keep designs simple** — Simpler designs produce better accessibility results
3. **Test exported PDFs** — Use PAC 2024 or Adobe Acrobat to check accessibility
4. **Be prepared to remediate** — You may need to fix PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Pro after export
5. **Consider your audience** — For simple documents, Canva + remediation can work well. For complex technical documents, consider starting in Word or InDesign

**When Canva works well:**

- Social media graphics (with alt text added)
- Simple flyers and announcements
- Presentations with straightforward layouts
- Quick visual content that will be remediated afterward

**When to use alternatives:**

- Complex multi-page reports
- Documents with extensive tables or data
- Forms that need to be fillable and accessible
- Content requiring precise PDF/UA compliance

### How do I make emails and newsletters accessible?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Emails follow the same principles as documents: use heading structure, add alt text to images, write descriptive links, and ensure good color contrast. The biggest difference is that many email clients have limited support for accessibility features, so simpler is better.

**Full explanation:**

Many state agencies send newsletters, announcements, and other email communications to the public. These emails need to be accessible too, especially if they contain important information about government services.

**DoIT best practice for newsletters:** Illinois DoIT generally recommends publishing newsletter content as webpage text when feasible instead of as PDFs. In practice, HTML webpage text is often easier to make and keep accessible than PDFs—especially when the alternative is a short webpage description that links to a PDF that may or may not be accessible. This DoIT best practice aligns with WCAG 2.1 Level AA rules and ADA Title II requirements. When creating newsletters, consider publishing the full content as a webpage and linking to it from your email, rather than attaching or linking to a PDF.

**Email accessibility essentials:**

| Element           | What to do                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Images**        | Add alt text; assume images may not display (many email clients block images by default) |
| **Links**         | Use descriptive link text ("View the 2025 report" not "Click here")                      |
| **Structure**     | Use heading styles if your email platform supports them; keep layouts simple             |
| **Color**         | Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning; ensure sufficient contrast                  |
| **Plain text**    | Include a plain-text version of HTML emails when possible                                |
| **Critical info** | Put essential information in text, not just in images or graphics                        |

**Platform-specific tips:**

**Outlook (desktop and web):**

- Use the built-in Accessibility Checker (Review > Check Accessibility)
- Add alt text to images (right-click > Edit Alt Text)
- Use heading styles from the formatting toolbar
- Avoid excessive use of tables for layout

**Gmail:**

- Gmail has limited accessibility features for composing
- Keep formatting simple — bold, italics, lists
- Add image descriptions in the email body if alt text isn't available
- Include a plain-text alternative when possible

**Constant Contact / Mailchimp / Email marketing tools:**

- Use the alt text field for all images (it's usually available when you click on an image)
- Use built-in heading styles rather than just making text larger
- Test with keyboard navigation before sending
- Preview in multiple email clients
- Include an accessible web version link at the top

**Common email accessibility mistakes:**

1. **Image-only emails** — If the entire message is a graphic, users who can't see images (or have them blocked) get nothing
2. **"Click here" links** — Screen readers often read links out of context; "View the 2025 Annual Report" is much better
3. **Text in images** — Avoid putting text in images when possible; if you must, ensure sufficient contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
4. **Low contrast** — Light gray text on white backgrounds is hard to read for everyone
5. **Complex layouts** — Multi-column layouts often break in email clients and screen readers

**The key principle:** Assume someone might read your email:

- With images turned off
- Using a screen reader
- On a mobile device
- With low vision

If your message still makes sense in all those scenarios, you're doing it right.

## Social Media Accessibility

### Do social media posts need to be accessible? How do I make them accessible?

**Yes.** Under the ADA Title II rule, new social media posts by state and local governments must meet accessibility standards. Pre-existing posts (made before the compliance date) are generally exempt unless they're currently used to provide or facilitate access to services, programs, or activities.

**Note:** Social media platforms themselves have accessibility limitations, but you can control the content you post.

**How to make social media posts accessible:**

**For all platforms:**

- Write in plain language
- Use CamelCase for hashtags (#AccessibilityMatters)
- Limit emoji use; don't place multiple emojis together
- Put hashtags at the end of posts
- Keep videos captioned
- Use sufficient color contrast in graphics

**For images:**

- Add alt text (most platforms support this now)
- Don't put essential text only in images
- Describe images in the post if alt text isn't available
- **How to add alt text on different platforms:**
  - **X (Twitter):** When composing, click the image > "Add description"
  - **Facebook:** Click the image > Edit > Alternative Text
  - **Instagram:** Advanced Settings > Write Alt Text (or edit after posting)
  - **LinkedIn:** Click the image while composing > Alt text

**For video:**

- Add captions (not just auto-generated — review for accuracy)
- Provide audio description for essential visual content if needed

## Procurement and Third-Party Tools

### What should I do when purchasing software or services?

When procuring technology products or services:

1. **Include accessibility requirements** in RFPs and contracts
2. **Request accessibility documentation** from vendors — Ask for accessibility conformance reports or documentation that addresses WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
3. **Evaluate accessibility claims** — Look for "Supports" not just "Partially Supports"
4. **Request a demo** of accessibility features
5. **Test with assistive technology** if possible

**IITAA procurement guidance:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html</a>

### What contract language should I use?

Illinois DoIT recommends including language similar to:

> "All information technology, including electronic information, software, systems, and equipment, developed or provided under this contract or procurement must comply with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (30 ILCS 587) Standards as published at <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa</a>"

### What is a VPAT? What is an ACR or MCAR?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** A **VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** is a standardized form vendors fill out to describe how their product meets accessibility standards. An **ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report)** is the completed VPAT — the actual document you request from vendors. **MCAR** stands for **Manufacturer's Conformance Accessibility Report**, which is essentially the same thing.

**Full explanation:**

**VPAT = the blank form; ACR = the completed report.** These terms are often used interchangeably, but technically:

- **VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** — The blank template created by the IT Industry Council (ITI) that provides a standard format for documenting accessibility conformance
- **ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report)** — The completed document a vendor provides, showing how their specific product meets (or doesn't meet) accessibility standards
- **MCAR (Manufacturer's Conformance Accessibility Report)** — Another term for ACR, emphasizing that it comes from the manufacturer/vendor

**What a VPAT/ACR tells you:**

1. **Which standard is evaluated** — Look for WCAG 2.1 Level AA (the current requirement)
2. **Conformance level for each criterion** — Common ratings include:
   - **Supports** — Fully meets the criterion
   - **Partially Supports** — Meets some but not all aspects
   - **Does Not Support** — Fails to meet the criterion
   - **Not Applicable** — Criterion doesn't apply to this product
3. **Remarks and explanations** — Details on how conformance is achieved or what barriers exist

**How to use VPATs in procurement:**

1. **Request a current VPAT/ACR** — Ask for one dated within the last 12 months
2. **Check the version** — Ensure it covers the exact product and version you're purchasing
3. **Look for "Supports"** — Products with many "Partially Supports" or "Does Not Support" ratings may require accessible alternatives
4. **Ask about remediation** — If issues exist, ask the vendor for a remediation timeline
5. **Include in contracts** — Require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance and ongoing accessibility support

**Where to find VPATs:**

- Check the vendor's website (often under "Accessibility" or "Legal")
- Request directly from your sales representative
- Search the <a href="https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITI VPAT template page</a> for the latest template version

**Red flags in a VPAT:**

- Very old date (more than 12-18 months)
- Wrong product version
- Many "Does Not Support" ratings for critical criteria
- Vague or missing explanations
- No commitment to remediation

**The bottom line:** Always request a current VPAT/ACR before purchasing technology. It won't guarantee accessibility, but it's your first line of defense against buying inaccessible tools.

## Glossary

**Confused by the jargon?** Here are plain-language definitions of common accessibility terms used throughout these FAQs:

### Legal and Standards Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)** — Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. **Title I** covers employment accommodations. **Title II** covers public services and requires state and local governments to make digital content accessible. <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about ADA</a>

**ADA Title II Web Rule** — The 2024 Department of Justice rule that requires state and local governments to meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards for public-facing digital content by April 24, 2026 (for entities with populations of 50,000+). <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a>

**IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** — Illinois state law (30 ILCS 587) requiring Illinois state agencies and universities to ensure their digital content is accessible to people with disabilities. Current standards require **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance. <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about IITAA</a>

**Section 504** — Part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that requires organizations receiving federal funding to ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities. <a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/section-504/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about Section 504</a>

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** — International standards published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that explain how to make digital content accessible. Think of them as a detailed checklist for making websites, documents, and apps usable by everyone. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about WCAG</a>

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA** — The specific accessibility standard required by both IITAA and ADA Title II. "Level AA" means meeting both Level A (minimum) and Level AA (standard) criteria. This is the compliance target for all public-facing digital content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View WCAG 2.1 Level AA Quick Reference</a>

### Procurement Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report)** — The completed document a vendor provides showing how their product meets (or doesn't meet) accessibility standards. This is the actual report you request from vendors — the filled-out version of a VPAT. <a href="https://www.section508.gov/sell/how-to-create-acr-with-vpat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn how to create an ACR</a>

**MCAR (Manufacturer's Conformance Accessibility Report)** — Another term for ACR, emphasizing that it comes from the manufacturer/vendor. Essentially the same as ACR.

**VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** — The blank template created by the IT Industry Council (ITI) that provides a standard format for documenting accessibility conformance. Vendors fill out VPATs to create ACRs. <a href="https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download VPAT template</a>

**VPAT ratings** — Common ratings in VPATs/ACRs include:

- **Supports** — Fully meets the criterion
- **Partially Supports** — Meets some but not all aspects
- **Does Not Support** — Fails to meet the criterion
- **Not Applicable** — Criterion doesn't apply to this product

### Technical Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**Alt text (Alternative text)** — A brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who can't see the image. Example: "Director Smith presenting award to Officer Jones at the annual ceremony." Best practice: Keep concise (roughly 15-25 words), though modern screen readers handle longer text when needed.

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** — Code attributes that provide additional information to screen readers when standard HTML isn't enough. Think of it as labels and instructions for assistive technology. Web developers typically handle ARIA implementation. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about ARIA Authoring Practices</a>

**Assistive technology** — Tools people with disabilities use to access digital content. Examples: screen readers (read content aloud), screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, alternative keyboards, switch devices.

**Captions** — Text displayed on screen that shows what's being said in a video. Different from subtitles (which assume you can hear) — captions also describe important sounds like "[door slams]" or "[music playing]." Required for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about captions</a>

**Color contrast ratio** — A measure of how readable text is against its background. WCAG 2.1 Level AA requires:

- **4.5:1** for normal text (smaller than 18pt regular or 14pt bold)
- **3:1** for large text (18pt+ regular or 14pt+ bold)
  <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test color contrast with WebAIM Contrast Checker</a>

**Focus indicator** — The visual outline that shows which element on a page is currently selected when navigating with a keyboard (usually by pressing Tab). Should be clearly visible so keyboard users know where they are.

**Heading structure** — Using proper heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) instead of just making text bold or larger. Screen readers use headings to navigate documents and web pages. Example: Use "Heading 1" for main titles, "Heading 2" for major sections, not just "Bold" formatting. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about heading structure</a>

**Keyboard navigation** — The ability to access and use all website features using only a keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, arrow keys) without a mouse. Required for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

**Screen reader** — Software that reads digital content aloud for people who are blind or have low vision. Common screen readers include <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVDA</a> (free, Windows), <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JAWS</a> (Windows), and VoiceOver (built into Mac/iOS).

**Transcript** — A written version of spoken audio content. Required for audio-only content (like podcasts) under WCAG 2.1 Level AA. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about transcripts</a>

### Content-Specific Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**Accessible document** — A document (Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel) that has proper structure (headings, not just bold text), alt text for images, readable tables, and other features that make it usable by assistive technologies. <a href="https://www.section508.gov/create/documents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn how to create accessible documents</a>

**Accessible template** — A document template (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) that's already set up with proper heading styles, accessible fonts, sufficient color contrast, and other accessibility features built in.

**Remediation** — The process of fixing inaccessible content to make it accessible. Example: Adding alt text to images, fixing heading structure, adding captions to videos.

**Semantic HTML** — HTML code that uses the correct elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for buttons, `<nav>` for navigation, `<heading>` for headings). This helps screen readers understand the structure and purpose of content.

### Process Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**Automated testing** — Using software tools (like <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE</a>, <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe DevTools</a>, Lighthouse) to automatically scan for accessibility issues. These tools catch many problems but can't detect everything — manual testing is also required. <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT Testing Resources</a>

**Manual testing** — Testing accessibility by actually using assistive technologies (keyboard navigation, screen readers) or checking things manually (color contrast, zoom testing). Required because automated tools miss many issues. <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT Testing Resources</a>

**Prioritization** — The process of deciding which accessibility issues to fix first when you can't fix everything at once. Typically based on impact: high-traffic content, critical services, and complete blockers come first.

**VPAT/ACR review** — The process of evaluating a vendor's accessibility documentation (VPAT/ACR) to determine if their product meets your accessibility requirements before purchasing.
