# Digital Accessibility FAQ for Illinois State Agency Employees

A practical guide to common accessibility questions for staff at Illinois state agencies.

---

## General Accessibility Questions

### What is digital accessibility?

**Quick answer:** Digital accessibility means everyone can use your digital content — websites, documents, videos, apps — regardless of disability.

**Full explanation:**

Digital accessibility means that websites, applications, documents, and other digital content are designed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, or alternative keyboards.

### How does digital accessibility and compliance fit into an agency's DEIA mission?

**Quick answer:** **Accessibility is the “A” in DEIA** — it’s how we deliver **equitable access** to services and information by **removing systemic barriers** in our digital work. And it’s not just an aspiration: it’s backed by **accountability** through enforceable law (IITAA + ADA Title II) and a **measurable standard** (**WCAG 2.1 Level AA**) with a compliance deadline.

**Why this is central to DEIA (not separate from it):**

- **DEIA is about removing systemic barriers to participation** — inaccessible digital content is a barrier that can exclude people with disabilities from information, programs, and services.
- **Government is “digital by default” now** — if the front door is a website, PDF, online form, dashboard, or video, accessibility determines who can actually use the service.
- **Equity becomes measurable** — WCAG 2.1 Level AA turns “we want to be inclusive” into clear, testable expectations for digital equity.
- **Accountability is real** — this goes beyond individual accommodations. IITAA has required accessibility for years, and the ADA Title II web rule reinforces enforceable requirements for public-facing digital content.

**What this means in practice (the DEIA “translation” into daily work):**

1. **Publish accessibly by default** — headings, link text, alt text, captions, and readable structure are part of equitable communication.
2. **Design for everyone** — sufficient contrast, keyboard use, and clear language aren’t “extras”; they determine who can participate.
3. **Procure responsibly** — requiring accessibility in contracts prevents inequity from being “outsourced” to inaccessible vendors/tools.
4. **Fix barriers when found** — treat accessibility issues like service issues, not optional enhancements.
5. **Start now** — timelines and learning approaches can vary, but the obligation to provide accessible services does not.

**The bottom line:** Accessibility is how DEIA commitments show up in the real world — **equitable access, with accountability** — and it’s backed by legal requirements that make the “A” measurable and enforceable.

### Why is there suddenly a deadline for digital accessibility?

**The deadline exists because the federal government finalized specific requirements on April 24, 2024.** The ADA Title II web accessibility rule establishes, for the first time, **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) with **firm deadlines** for state and local governments.

**What changed:**

- **Before April 2024:** Accessibility was required in principle, but enforcement was inconsistent and standards were vague. Agencies knew they should be accessible, but there were no specific technical requirements or firm deadlines.

- **After April 2024:** There are now **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) and **firm compliance deadlines** (April 24, 2026 for entities with populations of 50,000 or more). This creates clear accountability with testable criteria.

**Illinois already had requirements:** The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) has required accessible digital content since 2008. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and many agencies weren't fully aware of their obligations. The new federal rule adds another layer of accountability with a firm deadline.

**References:**

- <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IITAA History and Requirements</a> — Illinois requirements since 2008

### What does the April 2026 deadline cover?

**Everything digital and public-facing.** The deadline applies to all public-facing digital content, not just websites:

- **Websites and web applications** — All pages and interactive features
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations
- **Multimedia** — Videos (must have captions), audio (must have transcripts)
- **Mobile apps** — Any apps provided to the public
- **Social media** — Posts, images, and videos shared on social platforms (going forward)
- **Third-party content** — Embedded tools, maps, dashboards, widgets provided through contracts

**Why the scope is so broad:** Government services have moved online rapidly, especially since 2020. What used to be in-person services are now digital, making digital accessibility essential for equal access.

### Why does accessibility compliance require everyone's participation?

**Because web developers can only fix technical issues — they can't fix content.**

While web developers handle technical implementation (code structure, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes for screen readers), they **cannot** fix content created by others. Achieving compliance requires:

- **Content creators** — Write alt text for images, use proper heading styles, make documents accessible, add captions to videos
- **Designers** — Ensure color contrast meets requirements, design with keyboard navigation in mind
- **Procurement staff** — Include accessibility requirements in contracts for third-party tools
- **Web developers** — Implement technical accessibility standards, test with assistive technologies
- **Project managers** — Include accessibility in timelines and ensure it's addressed from project start
- **Leadership** — Allocate time, budget, and resources

**Example:** If you create a PDF report, the web team cannot add alt text to your images, fix your heading structure, or make your tables accessible. Those are content decisions only you can make as the document creator.

**The cost of waiting:** Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically **3-10 times more expensive** than building accessibility in from the start.

### Can managers delay accessibility work to "get more information first"?

**No. Managers cannot delay the work.** The April 24, 2026 deadline is a legal requirement, not a suggestion.

It's completely reasonable for managers to want clarity on scope, timeline, and resources. However, the deadline is firm and cannot be extended.

**Who to ask (so you get answers without losing time):**

- **Your web developers** — Web teams have been working on accessibility for years and can share practical guidance on common barriers, testing, and what “good” looks like. They write code (not your documents), but they’re often the best starting point for accessibility questions in general — especially as timelines get tight.
- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — Best source for questions about the **specific legal mandates** (IITAA + ADA Title II), timelines, and state guidance: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov

**What managers can do:**

- **Ask questions** — Understand what accessibility means for your team's work
- **Clarify scope** — Get a clear picture of what needs to be done
- **Plan resources** — Allocate time and budget needed for compliance
- **Prioritize work** — Determine what needs to be done first
- **Learn while doing** — Start the work now and adjust plans as you gain understanding

**What managers cannot do:**

- **Delay the work** — The deadline is firm and cannot be extended
- **Treat it as optional** — It's a legal requirement, not a "nice to have"
- **Push it to "later"** — Waiting makes the work more expensive and increases legal risk

**The reality:** Waiting until you fully understand everything will only make compliance harder to achieve. The best approach is to start the work now, ask questions along the way, and adjust plans as you gain more understanding.

### Who is affected by inaccessible digital content?

**Quick answer:** Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. (over 2.3 million people in Illinois alone) have some type of disability — including vision, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments.

**Full explanation:**

**Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the United States has some type of disability.** In Illinois, that's over 2.3 million people.

When digital content isn't accessible, agencies exclude millions of residents from accessing government information and services. Common disabilities include:

- **Vision impairments** — Blindness, low vision, color blindness
- **Hearing impairments** — Deafness, hearing loss
- **Motor disabilities** — Difficulty using a mouse, limited hand mobility
- **Cognitive disabilities** — Learning disabilities, memory difficulties, attention disorders

**Why this matters:** Accessible digital content isn't just about legal compliance — it's about ensuring equal access to government services for millions of Illinois residents.

### What is WCAG?

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** are international standards that explain how to make digital content accessible to people with disabilities. Think of them as a detailed checklist for making websites, documents, and apps usable by everyone.

WCAG is organized around four principles, known as **POUR**:

- **Perceivable** — People must be able to see or hear content (or have it described by assistive technology). Example: Images need text descriptions for people who can't see them.
- **Operable** — People must be able to use interface components and navigate content. Example: Everything that works with a mouse must also work with a keyboard.
- **Understandable** — Content and how to use it must be clear. Example: Error messages should explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **Robust** — Content must work with different technologies, including assistive tools like screen readers. Example: Use standard HTML so assistive technologies can interpret the content.

**Learn more:** <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/</a>

### What does "WCAG 2.1 Level AA" mean?

WCAG has three conformance levels:

- **Level A** — Minimum accessibility (must meet)
- **Level AA** — Standard accessibility (should meet) ← _Required for Illinois_
- **Level AAA** — Enhanced accessibility (may meet where feasible)

Illinois requires Level AA conformance, which includes all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

### Isn't accessibility just an IT issue? Shouldn't the web team fix all these issues?

**No. Accessibility is an organization-wide responsibility.** IT and web teams can fix technical barriers, but they can’t retroactively “repair” inaccessible content, designs, or procurement decisions without rework.

**Who owns what (high-level):**

- **Content creators**: headings, links, alt text, document structure, captions/transcripts
- **Designers**: contrast, focus visibility, layouts that work with keyboard/screen readers
- **Procurement/program teams**: require WCAG 2.1 AA in contracts; avoid buying inaccessible tools
- **Web/IT**: accessible code, testing, fixes, platform configuration
- **Managers/leaders**: time, tools, training, accountability

**Why “IT will fix it later” fails:**

- Accessibility is cheapest when done early; retrofits can be **3–10×** more expensive.
- A PDF without headings/alt text, a low-contrast design, or an inaccessible vendor tool can’t be “patched” by IT without changing the original work.

**Best practice:** “Shift left” — plan for accessibility in **content + design + procurement + build**, not at the end.

**The key takeaway:** You don't have to read everything on this site to understand the requirements. Pick the format that works best for you.

### I prefer to talk to someone rather than read FAQs. Who can help me?

**We understand that some people prefer conversation over documentation.** If you genuinely learn better through discussion, here are people who can help you get started:

**Internal resources at your agency:**

1. **Your web development team** — They've been implementing accessibility for years and can explain how it applies to your role
2. **Your IT coordinator or accessibility coordinator** — Many agencies have designated staff who can provide guidance
3. **Colleagues who've already started** — Ask around — someone on your team may already be working on accessibility and can share what they've learned

**Illinois state resources:**

- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — Email: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov — They can answer questions specific to Illinois state agency requirements
- **DoIT training sessions** — Check <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html</a> for scheduled training opportunities

**That said, it's important to be clear about timing:**

While we absolutely support different learning approaches, **learning style is not a reason to delay starting accessibility work.** The April 24, 2026 deadline applies regardless of how you prefer to learn.

**Here's a realistic approach:**

1. **Start now with the resources that work for you** — Whether that's videos, conversations with your web team, or hands-on practice with tools
2. **Schedule a conversation** — Reach out to your web team or DoIT to set up a discussion, but don't wait for that meeting to begin learning
3. **Use multiple approaches** — You might start with a quick 10-minute video to understand the basics, then have a conversation to ask specific questions about your work

**The reality:** Waiting to "talk to someone first" before starting any accessibility work delays compliance and increases risk. The most productive approach is to start learning through any available method (reading, videos, tools) while also scheduling conversations for specific questions.

**Bottom line:** Different learning styles are valid, but they're not a substitute for action. Use the learning approach that works best for you — but start now, not later.

## State Agency Applicability

### Why does your agency need to worry about digital accessibility? What does the April 2026 deadline mean?

**As an Illinois state agency, your agency has legal obligations under both state and federal law to ensure digital content is accessible.** The April 24, 2026 compliance deadline is not optional — it's a legal requirement that applies directly to all Illinois state agencies.

**Why this matters for Illinois state agencies:**

1. **State agency status** — Illinois state agencies fall under the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA), which has required accessible digital content since 2008. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 2024) require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

2. **Public service mission** — State agencies provide information, research, and resources to Illinois residents. Under ADA Title II, all public-facing digital content must be accessible to people with disabilities.

3. **Millions of Illinois residents need accessible digital content** — According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC data</a>, approximately **1 in 4 adults in the United States** have some type of disability. In Illinois, this represents over 2.3 million people. Common disabilities include mobility limitations, cognitive difficulties, hearing difficulties, and vision impairment. Many of these individuals rely on accessible digital content to access government services and information. When state agency websites or documents aren't accessible, we're potentially excluding millions of Illinoisans from critical government information and resources.

4. **Federal funding** — Many Illinois state agencies receive federal grants. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that any organization receiving federal funding ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities.

5. **The April 2026 deadline is firm** — The U.S. Department of Justice's ADA Title II web accessibility rule (published April 24, 2024) requires state and local governments with populations of 50,000 or more to achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance by **April 24, 2026**. Illinois has over 12 million residents, so this deadline applies to all state agencies.

**What "compliance" actually means:**

- All public-facing web pages must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- All public-facing documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint) must be accessible
- Videos must have captions; audio must have transcripts
- Third-party tools and embedded content you provide must be accessible
- Social media posts going forward must be accessible

**What happens if we don't comply:**

- The DOJ can investigate and pursue enforcement actions
- Individuals can file complaints or lawsuits
- Agencies could face legal costs, remediation costs, and reputational harm
- Most importantly, people with disabilities would be unable to access your information and services

**The reality of digital accessibility now:**

Accessibility is no longer just "best practice" — it's the law. The 2026 deadline creates accountability for what has always been the right thing to do. For state agencies, this means integrating accessibility into every aspect of your digital presence: websites, documents, social media, and any tools you provide to the public.

**The good news:** Many accessibility improvements also benefit everyone — clearer content, better-organized documents, and more usable websites make information easier to find and understand for all users.

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/title-ii-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule</a> — Federal accessibility requirements for state/local governments
- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Fact Sheet</a> — Plain language summary of requirements and deadlines

### If this has been a requirement, why hasn't your agency been doing this all along?

**Two things can be true at once:**

1. **Many agency web teams have been building accessible websites for years.** This isn’t “brand new” work for developers.
2. **The 2026 deadline changes who needs to participate.** Compliance now depends on *everyone who publishes digital content*, not just the web team.

**What the web team owns vs. what content teams own:**

- **Web team (website accessibility):** code structure, navigation, forms, keyboard support, ARIA where needed
- **Content creators (content accessibility):** accessible documents (Word/PDF/PowerPoint/Excel), image alt text, captions/transcripts, social media accessibility

**Why it feels different now:**

- **Accountability is stronger** — ADA Title II now points to a measurable standard (**WCAG 2.1 Level AA**) with a firm compliance deadline.
- **Scope is broader** — accessibility applies across websites *and* documents, multimedia, social media, and third-party tools used to deliver services.

**The bottom line:** Developers can’t make your PDFs accessible for you, and they can’t caption your videos after the fact. The standard is the same, but the work is spread across roles — and the deadline makes that shared responsibility unavoidable.

### What happens after April 24, 2026?

**Quick answer:** After April 24, 2026, all public-facing digital content from state and local governments must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Agencies that don't comply risk DOJ investigations, lawsuits, legal costs, and — most importantly — excluding people with disabilities from accessing government services.

**Full explanation:**

**After April 24, 2026, state and local governments must be in compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for all public-facing digital content.** Agencies that fail to meet this deadline may face several potential issues:

**Legal and enforcement consequences:**

- **Department of Justice investigations** — The DOJ can investigate complaints and pursue enforcement actions against non-compliant agencies
- **Complaints and lawsuits** — Individuals with disabilities can file complaints with the DOJ or pursue private lawsuits under the ADA
- **Legal costs and remediation expenses** — Agencies may face significant costs for legal defense, settlements, and emergency remediation of inaccessible content
- **Reputational harm** — Public awareness of accessibility failures can damage an agency's reputation and public trust

**Operational impacts:**

- **Service disruptions** — If complaints or lawsuits result in court orders, agencies may need to temporarily remove or restrict access to non-compliant content
- **Resource reallocation** — Emergency remediation efforts can divert staff time and budget from other priorities
- **Delayed projects** — New digital projects may be delayed while existing accessibility issues are addressed
- **Increased scrutiny** — Agencies with known accessibility issues may face increased oversight and reporting requirements

**What's covered by the deadline:**

The April 2026 deadline applies to all public-facing digital content, not just websites:

- **Websites** — All public-facing web pages, including forms, interactive features, and embedded content
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations published online or shared digitally
- **Mobile apps** — Any mobile applications provided to the public
- **Videos and multimedia** — All video content requires captions; audio content requires transcripts
- **Social media** — Posts, images, and videos shared on social platforms (going forward)
- **Third-party content** — Embedded maps, dashboards, widgets, and tools provided through contracts or agreements
- **Email communications** — Newsletters and other digital communications sent to the public

**The bottom line:** If it's digital and public-facing, it needs to be accessible by April 24, 2026. Agencies that start working toward compliance now have time to address issues systematically. Those that delay may face costly emergency remediation and legal consequences.

### I'm a content creator. Where do I start?

**As a content creator, your role is crucial — you're often the first person to make content accessible (or inaccessible).** Here's your quickstart guide:

**Start here (15 minutes) — Essential skills everyone needs:**

1. **Alt text for images** — Write a brief description of what's in every image (think: "If I were describing this over the phone, what would I say?")
2. **Use heading styles** — In Word/PowerPoint, use the Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 styles instead of just making text bigger
3. **Write clear link text** — Instead of "click here," write "Download the 2025 Annual Report"
4. **Check color contrast** — Make sure text is dark enough to read against its background

**These four skills will address 60-70% of common accessibility issues.**

**Learn the details (30 minutes each):**

**The key mindset shift:** Think about how someone using a screen reader (software that reads content aloud) or keyboard navigation would experience your content. If they can't see images, colors, or mouse interactions, can they still understand and use your content? If not, you need to provide alternatives.

### I'm a web developer. Where do I start?

**As a developer, you're building the foundation that makes everything else possible.** Here's your roadmap:

**Week 1 priority (must-do):**

1. **Keyboard navigation** — Ensure everything works without a mouse: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility</a>
2. **Semantic HTML** — Use proper HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>` not `<div>`): <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C: Page Structure</a>
3. **Form labels** — Every form field needs a proper label: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Forms</a>
4. **Install testing tools** — Get axe DevTools or WAVE browser extensions running

**Core technical standards:**

- **WCAG Quick Reference** — <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference</a> — Filter by Level AA
- **ARIA Authoring Practices** — <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C ARIA APG</a> (use semantic HTML first; ARIA second)
- **MDN Accessibility Guide** — <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla: Accessibility</a>

**Essential development practices:**

- **Focus management** — Visible focus indicators and logical tab order: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WCAG: Focus Visible</a>
- **Automate what you can** — Add <a href="https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a> and use <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a> in CI/tests where feasible

**Testing tools (integrate into your workflow):**

- **Automated checks** — axe DevTools or WAVE (plus Lighthouse as a secondary signal)
- **Manual checks** — keyboard-only + at least one screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver): <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVDA download</a>

**Deepen skills (optional):** <a href="https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev Learn Accessibility</a> and Illinois DoIT training: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html</a>

**Code review checklist (use this before every release):**

✓ Semantic HTML structure  
✓ Keyboard navigation works throughout  
✓ Focus indicators are visible  
✓ Color contrast meets 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text)  
✓ Images have alt text (or are marked decorative)  
✓ Forms have proper labels and error messages  
✓ ARIA is used correctly (or semantic HTML is preferred)  
✓ Automated tests pass (axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse)

**The key mindset:** Build accessibility in from the start, not as an afterthought. It's much easier and cheaper than retrofitting later. Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers regularly, not just at the end.

### I'm a manager. Where do I start?

**As a manager, your role is to create the organizational conditions for accessibility success.** You don’t need to become a technical expert — you need to set priorities, fund time/tools, and create accountability.

**Manager quick checklist (start here):**

1. **Name an owner** (or coordinator) for accessibility work and reporting
2. **Inventory what you publish** (sites, forms, PDFs, videos, social posts, vendor tools)
3. **Prioritize by impact** (high-traffic + high-stakes services first)
4. **Bake accessibility into process** (before publish / before purchase / before launch)
5. **Track progress** to the deadline (clear milestones, regular check-ins)

**1. Understand the legal requirements and timeline:**

- **The deadline is firm** — April 24, 2026 for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- **It applies to everything** — Websites, documents, videos, social media, mobile apps
- **It's not optional** — This is a legal requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA
- **Read the basics** — <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a> — Plain language summary of requirements

**2. Assess your current state:**

- **Audit existing content** — Identify all public-facing digital content (websites, documents, videos, social media)
- **Prioritize by impact** — Focus on high-traffic pages, frequently accessed documents, and critical services first
- **Identify gaps** — Use automated tools and manual testing to find accessibility issues
- **Estimate remediation effort** — Understand the scope of work needed

**3. Build accessibility into your processes:**

- **Include accessibility in project timelines** — Don't treat it as an add-on; build it into initial project plans
- **Require accessibility in procurement** — Include WCAG 2.1 AA requirements in RFPs and vendor contracts
- **Establish content review processes** — Ensure documents and content are checked for accessibility before publication
- **Create accessibility checkpoints** — Build accessibility reviews into your content approval workflows

**4. Allocate resources strategically:**

- **Training budget** — Invest in accessibility training for content creators, developers, and designers
- **Tools and software** — Provide accessibility testing tools (WAVE, axe DevTools, PDF accessibility checkers)
- **Time allocation** — Recognize that creating accessible content may take slightly longer initially
- **Expert support** — Consider accessibility consultants or specialists for complex projects

**5. Support your team:**

- **Make it a priority** — Communicate that accessibility is important and expected
- **Remove barriers** — Ensure staff have access to training, tools, and time needed
- **Celebrate progress** — Recognize teams and individuals who successfully implement accessibility
- **Learn alongside your team** — Attend training sessions to understand what your team is learning

**6. Establish accountability:**

- **Assign responsibilities** — Clearly define who is responsible for accessibility in each area
- **Set expectations** — Make accessibility part of job descriptions and performance expectations
- **Track progress** — Monitor compliance status and remediation efforts
- **Regular check-ins** — Include accessibility in regular team meetings and project reviews

**7. Connect with resources:**

- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — Email: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov — Website: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/</a>
- **Accessibility coordinators** — Identify or designate an accessibility coordinator in your organization
- **Peer networks** — Connect with other managers facing similar challenges
- **Legal/compliance team** — Work with your legal or compliance office to understand requirements

**8. Keep it sustainable (so it doesn’t collapse after one push):**

- Build accessibility into ongoing operations (publish + purchase + build), not a one-time project
- Maintain documentation, milestones, and ownership

**The bottom line:** As a manager, you don't need to become a technical expert, but you do need to create the organizational support, resources, and accountability that enable your team to succeed. The April 2026 deadline is firm, but with proper planning and support, your organization can achieve compliance.

## ADA Title II Web Rule

### What is the ADA Title II web accessibility rule?

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule establishing specific technical requirements for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rule requires state and local governments to make their public-facing digital content meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official fact sheet:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>

### How does Title II differ from Title I? I'm familiar with Title I, but Title II is new to me.

**Quick answer:** **Title I** covers **employment** and reasonable accommodations for employees. **Title II** covers **public services** and requires state and local governments to proactively make public-facing digital content meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** by the compliance deadline.

**The key difference:** Title I is about **individual workplace accommodations**. Title II is about **equitable public access** to government services — including digital services — using a **measurable standard** (WCAG 2.1 AA).

**Title I (Employment):**

- Focus: employees and job applicants
- Approach: reasonable accommodations, case-by-case (interactive process)
- “Standard”: no single technical web standard required — it’s about reasonable access in context

**Examples:** accessible internal documents when needed; assistive tech software; modified equipment.

**Title II (Public Services):**

- Focus: programs/services offered to the public
- Approach: proactive accessibility for everyone (not just when requested)
- Standard: **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** for public-facing web content and mobile apps (per the 2024 web rule)

**Examples:** accessible websites/forms; accessible PDFs; captions for videos; accessible third‑party tools used to deliver services.

**Key differences (at a glance):**

| Aspect                  | Title I (Employment)                                          | Title II (Public Services)                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Who it applies to**   | Employers (private and public)                                | State and local governments                    |
| **What it covers**      | Employment practices and workplace accommodations             | Public programs, services, and activities      |
| **Approach**            | Case-by-case reasonable accommodations                        | Proactive accessibility for all public content |
| **Technical standards** | No specific standards; accommodations determined individually | WCAG 2.1 Level AA required                     |
| **Timeline**            | Accommodations provided when requested                        | Must be compliant by April 2026 deadline       |
| **Scope**               | Individual employee needs                                     | All public-facing digital content              |
| **Internal vs. public** | Primarily internal (workplace)                                | Primarily public-facing content                |

**Why it can feel “new”:** The **web rule is recent (April 2024)** — it’s the first time DOJ set a specific digital standard under Title II.

**For Illinois state agencies:** You must do both — **Title I** for employees and **Title II** for the public.

**The bottom line:** Title I is about employment accommodations (what you're familiar with), while Title II is about making public services accessible to everyone (what the 2026 deadline addresses). The April 2024 web rule is the first time Title II has had specific technical standards for digital content, which is why it may feel new even though Title II itself has existed since 1990.

- **Overview of ADA Titles:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/ada_intro.htm</a>

### When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?

| Entity Size                  | Compliance Deadline |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Population of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Population less than 50,000  | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026**.

### Does ADA Title II apply to internal documents?

**No, the ADA Title II web rule does not directly apply to purely internal content.** The rule specifically covers "services, programs, and activities provided or made available" to the public.

**However**, internal content may still need to be accessible under:

- **ADA Title I** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which could include making internal systems accessible
- **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities
- **IITAA** — Illinois law covers intranets and internal systems used by state employees

**Best practice:** Make internal documents accessible proactively. It's easier than retrofitting later, and you may have employees with disabilities who need access.

### What content is covered by the ADA Title II rule?

The rule covers all web content and mobile apps that state and local governments provide or make available to the public, including:

- Websites and web applications
- Mobile apps
- Online documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Online forms and applications
- Social media posts (going forward)
- Video and audio content
- Third-party content provided through contracts or agreements

### Are there any exceptions to the ADA Title II rule?

Yes, limited exceptions exist for:

1. **Archived content** — Content created before the compliance date that is not currently used for services
2. **Pre-existing documents** — Documents created before the deadline (unless used to apply for or access services)
3. **Third-party content** — Content posted by third parties not under contract
4. **Password-protected individual documents** — Documents specific to one person's account
5. **Pre-existing social media posts** — Posts made before the compliance deadline

**Important:** Even when exceptions apply, you may still need to provide accessible alternatives upon request.

3. **Missing form labels** — form fields without associated labels
4. **Keyboard inaccessibility** — interactive elements that can't be reached or operated with a keyboard
5. **Missing or improper heading structure** — headings used for styling rather than structure
6. **Missing captions or transcripts** for video/audio content
7. **Links that don't make sense out of context** — "click here" or "read more"
8. **Missing page titles** or duplicate titles across pages
9. **Tables without proper headers** — data tables lacking row/column headers
10. **Auto-playing media** without controls

### Do I need to caption all videos?

Yes, for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance:

- **Pre-recorded video with audio** — Requires synchronized captions
- **Live video with audio** — Requires captions (can be auto-generated with corrections)
- **Pre-recorded audio only** — Requires a text transcript
- **Video with essential visual content** — May require audio description

### What about third-party widgets and embedded content?

You are responsible for the accessibility of third-party content that you embed or integrate into your website through contracts or agreements. This includes:

- Payment processors
- Scheduling tools
- Chat widgets
- Embedded maps
- Social media feeds
- Survey tools

**Best practice:** Request accessibility documentation from vendors before purchasing, and include accessibility requirements in contracts.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a> (see section on "Third-Party Content Provided Through Contracts or Agreements")

### Do embedded dashboards and maps (like Tableau or ArcGIS) need to be accessible?

**Quick answer:** **Yes.** If you embed a dashboard or map to deliver a public service, it must be accessible under IITAA and ADA Title II (WCAG 2.1 AA). If the embedded tool can’t be made accessible, you must provide an **equivalent accessible alternative**.

**Minimum requirements (what “accessible” means):**

- Works **with keyboard only** (no mouse required)
- Works with a **screen reader** (labels, controls, and structure make sense)
- Meets **contrast** requirements and has visible focus

**What to do (fast, practical):**

1. **Get a VPAT/ACR** and require WCAG 2.1 AA in the contract
2. **Test the workflow** (keyboard + screen reader + axe/WAVE) before publishing
3. **Provide an alternative** if needed (common options):
   - **Dashboards:** accessible data table / CSV download + plain-language summary
   - **Maps:** accessible list/table of locations + text explanation of what the map shows

**Reference:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a>

### Does our agency's password-protected intranet need to be accessible?

**Quick answer:** Password-protected intranet sites for employees only are generally exempt from ADA Title II, but **may still need to be accessible under Illinois state law (IITAA), ADA Title I (employment), and Section 504** (federal funding). Always prioritize employee accommodations if requested.

**Full explanation:**

**It depends.** Password-protected intranet sites that are **only accessible to agency employees** (not the public) are generally **exempt from the ADA Title II web rule**, but they may still need to be accessible under other laws.

**ADA Title II exemption:**

The ADA Title II web rule specifically covers content "provided or made available to the public." Password-protected intranet sites that are:

- Only accessible to agency employees
- Not accessible to the general public
- Protected by authentication (login required)

...are generally **exempt from ADA Title II WCAG 2.1 AA requirements**.

**However, other legal requirements may still apply:**

1. **IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** — Illinois state law requires that intranets and internal systems used by state employees be accessible
2. **ADA Title I (Employment)** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. If an employee needs to access the intranet to do their job, it may need to be accessible
3. **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities

**Best practice:** Make your intranet accessible proactively. It supports employees with disabilities, prevents costly retrofitting, and ensures compliance with IITAA.

**Resources:**

- **ADA Title I (Employment):** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/</a>

### What about archived documents on the intranet?

**Quick answer:** Truly archived documents that are no longer used may be exempt, but you must still provide accessible alternatives **upon request** if an employee needs them.

**Full explanation:**

**Archived documents that are not currently used may be exempt** — but you must still provide accessible alternatives **upon request**.

**For truly archived documents:**

- Historical records not currently referenced
- Old versions replaced by newer documents
- Content no longer needed for business operations

**Exception:** Even archived documents should be made accessible if they're:

- Referenced or linked from active intranet pages
- Part of a searchable document library
- Needed for reference or historical context

**If an employee requests access to archived content, you must provide an accessible version.**

### After April 2026, do all new documents need to be accessible?

**Quick answer:** Yes. All new documents created or published after April 24, 2026 must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards from day one — whether posted publicly or on an intranet.

**Full explanation:**

**Yes. All new documents created after the April 24, 2026 deadline must be accessible** — whether they're posted publicly or on an intranet.

**For new documents (created after April 24, 2026):**

- **Yes** — All new documents (PDFs, Excel, Word, PowerPoint) must be accessible
- Make accessibility part of your document creation workflow
- This includes documents created internally or received from external sources

**For existing documents (created before April 24, 2026):**

- **Prioritize by usage** — Focus on:
  - Documents actively used by employees or the public
  - Frequently accessed documents
  - Documents required for services or job functions
  - Documents linked from main pages
- **Archived documents** — May remain as-is unless someone requests access, at which point you must provide an accessible version

**Key principle:** The requirement is to ensure people with disabilities can access the information they need. If a document is truly archived and never accessed, it may not need immediate remediation. But if anyone needs it, you must provide an accessible version.

**Best practices:**

1. **Create an accessibility workflow** — Make all new documents accessible before posting
2. **Prioritize remediation** — Focus on frequently used existing documents
3. **Respond to requests** — Have a process to quickly provide accessible versions of archived documents upon request
4. **Document your efforts** — Keep records of what's accessible, what needs work, and any requests you've fulfilled

<a id="third-party-tool-testing"></a>
### How do I test third-party tool compliance? What do I do to verify (for example, Docebo or DocuSign) compliance?

**Quick answer:** Don’t rely on vendor claims. Request a current VPAT, then test your **real workflows** with (1) keyboard-only navigation, (2) a screen reader, and (3) an automated checker (axe/WAVE). Document issues and require fixes (or an accessible alternative) before you go live.

**Minimum test plan (30–60 minutes):**

1. **Pick 2–3 real workflows** (example: “sign a document,” “enroll and complete a course,” “submit a form”).
2. **Run an automated scan** (axe DevTools or WAVE) on each workflow screen:
   - **axe DevTools** — <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.deque.com/axe/</a>
   - **WAVE** — <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wave.webaim.org/</a>
3. **Keyboard-only check** (no mouse):
   - You can reach everything (Tab/Shift+Tab) and activate it (Enter/Space)
   - Focus is visible and never gets “stuck”
4. **Screen reader spot-check** (at least one):
   - **NVDA** (free) — <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nvaccess.org/</a>
   - **VoiceOver** (built-in on Mac/iOS)
   - Confirm labels make sense, errors are announced, and the workflow can be completed
5. **Document what you found**:
   - Date/version tested, workflow steps, issues, and screenshots
   - “Workaround/alternative provided” if the vendor can’t fix quickly

**Procurement/contract expectations (what to ask for):**

- **VPAT/ACR** for the exact product/version you’re buying/using
- A list of **known issues** + vendor **remediation timeline**
- Contract language requiring **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** and support for accessibility fixes

**Ongoing monitoring (keep it lightweight):**

- Re-test after **major updates**, configuration/theme changes, or new integrations
- Track user feedback and escalate issues to the vendor

**Resources:**

- DoIT Testing Resources: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html</a>
- Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline: <a href="https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/</a>

**The bottom line:** Test the workflows people actually use. If the tool can’t be made accessible quickly, you still need to provide an **accessible alternative** for the service.

### Our agency uses DocuSign to digitally sign documents. Is this something that falls under WCAG compliance?

**Quick answer:** Yes. If you use DocuSign for public-facing services, the **signing workflow** and the **documents you send** must be accessible.

**What to do (in order):**

1. **Make the documents accessible first** (Word/PDF before upload). DocuSign can’t “fix” an inaccessible document.
2. **Request DocuSign’s current VPAT/ACR** for your version and configuration.
3. **Test the real signing workflow** using the steps in: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#third-party-tool-testing)
4. **Have an accessible alternative** if a user can’t complete the signing process (example: an accessible PDF form + supported return method, in-person or assisted signing).

**The bottom line:** Your agency is responsible for accessibility for services delivered through DocuSign. Start with accessible documents, verify the workflow, and keep a backup method ready.

### Is a Learning Management System (LMS) like Docebo WCAG 2.1 compliant?

**Quick answer:** Sometimes partially. Even if the LMS platform is improving, **your course content and configuration still have to be accessible**.

**What can affect LMS accessibility:**

- Platform version/configuration
- Custom themes/branding
- Plugins/integrations
- Specific feature limitations (quizzes, embedded media, uploads, etc.)

**Accessible LMS course checklist (high impact):**

1. **Documents** — Upload accessible Word/PDF/PowerPoint files (make the source accessible first).
2. **Video/audio** — Captions for video; transcripts for audio; fix auto-captions.
3. **Images** — Alt text for images/graphics; don’t put essential text only in images.
4. **Structure** — Clear headings and descriptive link text; predictable navigation and module names.
5. **Interactivity** — Quizzes/forms are keyboard accessible, with clear labels and error messages.
6. **Color** — Sufficient contrast and no “color-only” meaning.
7. **Test the course** using: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#third-party-tool-testing)

**Resources:**

- WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference (Level AA): <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa</a>
- WebAIM Contrast Checker: <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>

**The bottom line:** Treat the LMS like any other third-party tool: verify the platform, and ensure the content you upload is accessible.

### If we have existing content like Tableau dashboards, ArcGIS maps, or Docebo online courses, do those fall into the exemption category? Or do they need to be made immediately accessible?

**Quick answer:** If it’s **currently used to provide public services**, it needs to be accessible (no “archived content” exemption). If it’s **truly archived and not used**, it may be exempt — but you still must provide an accessible alternative **upon request**.

**The key distinction:**

- **Currently used for services** = Must be accessible
- **Archived/not currently used** = May be exempt, but must provide accessible alternatives upon request

**What to do (works for dashboards, maps, and courses):**

1. **Inventory** what exists and label it **active** vs. **archived**
2. **Prioritize** by impact (high-traffic, high-stakes, frequently used)
3. **Make it accessible or provide an equivalent accessible alternative**, such as:
   - **Dashboards/maps:** accessible data tables/CSV downloads + plain-language summaries
   - **Courses:** accessible documents + captions/transcripts + accessible quiz interactions
4. **Test** using the workflow approach in: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#third-party-tool-testing)
5. **Document** what you changed, what remains, and the alternatives you provide

**Tool-specific notes (common pain points):**

- **Tableau**: interactive charts often need **accessible tables** and clear descriptions. Don’t rely on hover-only tooltips.
- **ArcGIS**: complex interactive maps frequently need **equivalent text + data** (tables, lists of locations, and a written summary of what the map shows).
- **Docebo/LMS courses**: the platform may be “mostly accessible,” but **uploaded content and course design** are where failures usually occur (captions, docs, images, quizzes, navigation).

**Resources:**

- ADA Title II Web Rule: <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>
- DoIT Accessibility Guidance: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html</a>

**The bottom line:** If the public needs it to access a service, it must be accessible. If you can’t make the tool fully accessible quickly, provide an **equivalent accessible alternative** and document the remediation plan.

## Content Accessibility (Documents, PDFs, Presentations)

### What about photos your agency takes at events — like speeches or awards ceremonies? Do those need to be accessible?

**Yes, if you're sharing them digitally.** Any photos published on your agency's website, social media, or in digital documents need alt text (alternative text) that describes the image for people who can't see it.

**What is alt text?**

Alt text is a brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who are blind or have low vision. It's also displayed if an image fails to load.

**How to write good alt text for event photos:**

- **Be specific and concise** — Describe what's actually happening in the photo
- **Include relevant names** — If someone is being recognized, name them
- **Describe the context** — What event is this? What's the setting?
- **Keep it brief** — Usually 1-2 sentences is sufficient

**Examples:**

| Photo Type     | Poor Alt Text             | Good Alt Text                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Award ceremony | "Photo" or "IMG_4523.jpg" | "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe at the annual agency awards ceremony" |
| Speech         | "Person speaking"         | "Agency director addresses attendees at the 2025 victim services conference"                                      |
| Group photo    | "Group of people"         | "Agency research team staff at the December 2025 all-hands meeting"                                               |
| Event venue    | "Conference room"         | "Attendees networking during a break at the Illinois Criminal Justice Summit"                                    |

**Where to add alt text:**

- **Website/CMS** — Look for the "alt text" or "image description" field when uploading
- **Word documents** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **PowerPoint** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **Social media** — Each platform has an alt text option (see Social Media Accessibility section)
- **Email** — Outlook and Gmail both support alt text for images

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A</a> — All non-text content must have a text alternative

### How long should alt text be?

**Aim for 125 characters or fewer** — this is about 15-25 words. Some older screen readers truncate alt text at 125 characters, and shorter descriptions are easier for users to process.

- **Maximum:** Stay under 150 characters when possible
- **Ideal:** 125 characters or less
- **Too short:** Single words like "photo" or "image" don't help anyone
- **Too long:** If you need more than 150 characters, consider whether a visible caption would work better

**The bottom line:** If you took the photo because it captures something meaningful, that meaning needs to be conveyed in alt text for people who can't see it — but keep it concise.

### How do I handle complex images like charts, graphs, or infographics?

Some images — like charts, graphs, infographics, or images containing lots of text — need more than a brief alt text. Here's how to handle them:

**For charts and graphs with data:**

1. **Alt text:** Provide a brief summary of what the chart shows (e.g., "Bar chart showing Illinois crime rates declining 15% from 2020 to 2024")
2. **Data table:** Include the underlying data in an accessible table format, either directly below the chart or linked nearby
3. **Long description:** If the trends or patterns matter, describe them in the body text

**Example for a chart:**

- **Alt text:** "Line graph showing agency grant funding from 2020-2025. Full data in table below."
- **Below the image:** An accessible HTML table with the actual numbers

**For infographics or images with lots of text:**

1. **Don't use images of text** — If possible, present the information as actual text on the page instead of as an image
2. **If you must use an image:** Provide the full text content in one of these ways:
   - A "long description" link that opens the full text
   - An expandable section below the image with the complete text
   - A text summary in the body of the page

**For scanned documents or PDF images:**

1. **Best approach:** Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the image to actual text
2. **If OCR isn't possible:** Provide a text transcript of the document content
3. **Alt text:** Describe what the document is (e.g., "Scanned letter from Governor dated June 2025. Full transcript below.")

**General rule for complex images:**

- **Alt text:** Brief summary + tell users where to find more detail
- **Long description:** Provide full information in accessible text format nearby or linked

**Example patterns:**

| Image Type       | Alt Text Approach                                     | Additional Requirement    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data chart       | "Chart showing [brief conclusion]. Data table below." | Accessible data table     |
| Infographic      | "Infographic about [topic]. Full text follows."       | Complete text version     |
| Scanned document | "[Document type] from [source]. Transcript provided." | Text transcript           |
| Complex diagram  | "Diagram of [subject]. Described in detail below."    | Detailed text description |

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content</a> — Complex images need text alternatives that serve equivalent purpose
- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#images-of-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text - Level AA</a> — Avoid images of text; use actual text when possible

### How do I make images accessible on social media, Constant Contact, or Canva?

Sharing infographics, charts, or images with text on platforms like social media, Constant Contact, or Canva presents unique challenges because you often can't add data tables or long descriptions directly.

**Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn):**

- **Alt text limits vary** — Most platforms allow 100-1000 characters for alt text, but keep it concise
- **Use the post text** — Put key information in the post caption itself, not just the image
- **Link to more** — If sharing a complex infographic, link to a webpage with the full accessible version
- **Don't rely on the image alone** — If the image contains important text or data, repeat it in your post

**Example social media approach:**

- **Image:** Infographic showing "5 Steps to Accessible Documents"
- **Alt text:** "Infographic listing 5 steps to create accessible documents. Steps listed in post."
- **Post text:** "Here are 5 steps to accessible documents: 1) Use heading styles, 2) Add alt text to images, 3) Use meaningful link text, 4) Check color contrast, 5) Run accessibility checker. Full guide: [link]"

**Constant Contact and email marketing:**

- **Alt text field:** Constant Contact has an alt text field for images — use it
- **Character limit:** Keep alt text brief since email clients vary in support
- **Avoid image-only emails** — Don't put critical information only in images; many users have images disabled by default
- **Provide text version** — Key messages should appear as actual text in the email, not just in graphics

**Example email approach:**

- **Image:** Event announcement graphic with date, time, location
- **Alt text:** "Agency training event - details in text below"
- **Email body:** Include all event details as actual text below the image

**Canva:**

- **Canva supports alt text** — When you download or share, Canva can include alt text
- **Better approach:** Export important text content separately, not just as an image
- **For presentations:** Use Canva's presentation mode which supports alt text, or export to PowerPoint and add alt text there
- **For print vs. digital:** If creating something for digital distribution, consider whether it needs to be an image at all

**General rule for social/email:**

If you're sharing a complex image on social media or email, ask yourself: "If someone can't see this image, can they still get the information?" If not, you need to provide the content as text — either in the post/email body or linked to an accessible page.

### Who should write the alt text for photos?

**Ideally, the person supplying the photo should also supply the alt text.** They know what's happening in the image, who's pictured, and why it matters. If you're submitting photos for the website, a newsletter, or social media, include alt text with your submission.

- **You were there** — You know the context, the names, and what made the moment significant
- **You chose the photo** — You selected it for a reason; that reason should be in the alt text
- **It saves time** — The web team or communications staff shouldn't have to guess who's in the photo or what event it's from

**Best practice:** When submitting photos, include a simple list: "Photo 1: [alt text], Photo 2: [alt text]" etc.

### Are captions the same as alt text?

**No — captions and alt text serve different purposes and both may be needed.**

|                 | Caption                                              | Alt Text                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visibility**  | Visible to everyone on the page                      | Hidden; only read by screen readers or shown if image fails to load |
| **Purpose**     | Provides context, credits, or additional information | Describes the image for people who can't see it                     |
| **Who sees it** | All users                                            | Users with screen readers, or when images don't load                |
| **Required?**   | Optional but often helpful                           | Required for accessibility                                          |

**Example of both working together:**

- **Alt text:** "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe"
- **Caption:** "Officer John Doe receives the 2025 Excellence Award for his work on community violence intervention programs. Photo: Agency"

The alt text describes what's visually happening. The caption adds context that all readers benefit from (what the award was for, photo credit).

**When you might skip detailed alt text:**

- **Purely decorative images** — If a photo adds no meaningful information (like a decorative border), mark it as decorative. But event photos are almost never purely decorative.
- **Caption already describes it** — If there's a visible caption that fully describes the visual content, alt text can be briefer — but alt text is still required (even if just "Award ceremony as described in caption").

### Do all documents need to be accessible?

For public-facing documents, yes. Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, conventional electronic documents must be accessible, including:

- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations

**Exceptions may apply for:**

- Pre-existing documents not currently used for services (still must provide accessible alternatives upon request)
- Password-protected documents specific to an individual's account

### How do I make a Word document accessible?

Key steps for accessible Word documents:

1. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
2. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click > Edit Alt Text
3. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
4. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**
6. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon
7. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

### How do I make a PDF accessible?

The best approach depends on the source:

**If you have the source document (Word, InDesign, etc.):**

1. Make the source document accessible first
2. Export to PDF with accessibility settings enabled
3. Check and fix any remaining issues in Adobe Acrobat Pro

**If you only have the PDF:**

1. Run the Accessibility Checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro
2. Add tags using the Reading Order tool
3. Add alt text to images
4. Set the document language
5. Verify reading order
6. Test with a screen reader

**Testing tool:** PAC 2024 (free) — <a href="https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/</a>

### Is Canva accessible?

**Canva has made significant progress on accessibility** and offers several helpful features:

**What Canva does well:**

- **Design Accessibility checker** — Checks contrast, alt text, and typography
- **Automatic alt text suggestions** — AI-powered suggestions for image descriptions
- **Reading order and heading tagging** — Better structure for PDFs
- **Easier for non-designers** — More accessible than learning Adobe InDesign

**Important limitation:** Canva PDFs are not fully WCAG or PDF/UA compliant out of the box.

**Best practices for using Canva:**

1. **Use the Design Accessibility tool before exporting** — It will catch many issues
2. **Keep designs simple** — Simpler designs produce better accessibility results
3. **Test exported PDFs** — Use PAC 2024 or Adobe Acrobat to check accessibility
4. **Be prepared to remediate** — You may need to fix PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Pro after export
5. **Consider your audience** — For simple documents, Canva + remediation can work well. For complex technical documents, consider starting in Word or InDesign

**When Canva works well:**

- Social media graphics (with alt text added)
- Simple flyers and announcements
- Presentations with straightforward layouts
- Quick visual content that will be remediated afterward

**When to use alternatives:**

- Complex multi-page reports
- Documents with extensive tables or data
- Forms that need to be fillable and accessible
- Content requiring precise PDF/UA compliance

### How do I make Excel spreadsheets accessible?

Key steps for accessible Excel files:

1. **Use a simple, logical structure** — Avoid blank rows/columns for spacing
2. **Name worksheets descriptively** — Not "Sheet1," "Sheet2"
3. **Define table headers** — Format as Table with header row
4. **Add alt text to charts and images**
5. **Avoid merged cells** when possible
6. **Use sufficient color contrast**
7. **Don't rely on color alone** to convey information
8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

### How do I make PowerPoint presentations accessible?

Key steps for accessible PowerPoint:

1. **Use built-in slide layouts** — Don't create from blank slides
2. **Add alt text to images, charts, and graphics**
3. **Ensure reading order is correct** — Home > Arrange > Selection Pane
4. **Use unique, descriptive slide titles**
5. **Use sufficient color contrast**
6. **Make hyperlinks descriptive**
7. **Add captions to embedded videos**
8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

## Social Media Accessibility

### Do social media posts need to be accessible?

Yes. Under the ADA Title II rule, new social media posts by state and local governments must meet accessibility standards. Pre-existing posts (before the compliance deadline) are exempt.

**Note:** Social media platforms themselves have accessibility limitations, but you can control the content you post.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Social Media</a> (see section on "Social Media Posts")

### How do I make social media posts accessible?

**For all platforms:**

- Write in plain language
- Use CamelCase for hashtags (#AccessibilityMatters)
- Limit emoji use; don't place multiple emojis together
- Put hashtags at the end of posts
- Keep videos captioned
- Use sufficient color contrast in graphics

**For images:**

- Add alt text (most platforms support this now)
- Don't put essential text only in images
- Describe images in the post if alt text isn't available

**For video:**

- Add captions (not just auto-generated — review for accuracy)
- Provide audio description for essential visual content if needed

## Procurement and Third-Party Tools

### What should I do when purchasing software or services?

When procuring technology products or services:

1. **Include accessibility requirements** in RFPs and contracts
2. **Request accessibility documentation** from vendors — Ask for accessibility conformance reports or documentation that addresses WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
3. **Evaluate accessibility claims** — Look for "Supports" not just "Partially Supports"
4. **Request a demo** of accessibility features
5. **Test with assistive technology** if possible

### What contract language should I use?

Illinois DoIT recommends including language similar to:

> "All information technology, including electronic information, software, systems, and equipment, developed or provided under this contract or procurement must comply with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (30 ILCS 587) Standards as published at <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa</a>"

## Key Terms

**Confused by the jargon?** Here are plain-language definitions of common accessibility terms:

**Alt text (Alternative text)** — A brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who can't see the image. Example: "Director Smith presenting award to Officer Jones."

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** — Code attributes that provide additional information to screen readers when standard HTML isn't enough. Think of it as labels and instructions for assistive technology.

**Assistive technology** — Tools people with disabilities use to access digital content. Examples: screen readers (read content aloud), screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, alternative keyboards.

**Captions** — Text displayed on screen that shows what's being said in a video. Different from subtitles (which assume you can hear) — captions also describe important sounds.

**Focus indicator** — The visual outline that shows which element on a page is currently selected when navigating with a keyboard (usually by pressing Tab). Should be clearly visible.

**Keyboard navigation** — The ability to use a website or application using only keyboard keys (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys) without needing a mouse.

**Reading order** — The sequence in which content is read by screen readers. Should match the logical flow of information (top to bottom, left to right in English).

**Screen reader** — Software that reads website and document content aloud for people who are blind or have low vision. Examples: NVDA (free), JAWS, VoiceOver (built into Macs/iPhones).

**Semantic HTML** — Using HTML elements for their intended purpose (`<button>` for buttons, `<nav>` for navigation) rather than generic `<div>` elements. This helps assistive technologies understand page structure.

**VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** — A document vendors provide that explains how well their product meets accessibility standards. Look for "Supports" rather than "Partially Supports."

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** — International standards for making digital content accessible. Pronounced "wuh-kag."
