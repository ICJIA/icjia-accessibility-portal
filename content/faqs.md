## Quick Start (Read this first)

### Executive summary: what you need to know right now

**Feeling overwhelmed? Start here.** You don't need to understand everything to begin making progress.

_Last updated: January 3, 2026_

**What you need to know right now:**

1. **The deadline is real:** April 24, 2026. Illinois state agencies must make all public-facing digital content accessible to people with disabilities — websites, documents, PDFs, videos, social media, and mobile apps.

2. **Two laws require this:**
   - **Illinois law:** The <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA)</a> has required accessible digital content for state agencies since 2008. The current <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/doit-news/accessibility-news/iitaa-2-1-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IITAA 2.1 standards</a> (effective June 24, 2024) require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
   - **Federal law:** The <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Accessibility Rule</a> (published April 24, 2024) requires state and local governments to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA by April 24, 2026. The <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/24/2024-07758/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-accessibility-of-web-information-and-services-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full rule text</a> is in the Federal Register.

3. **This applies to your work:** If you create documents, websites, videos, social media posts, or procure digital tools — accessibility is part of your job now.

4. **The standard is clear:** <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WCAG 2.1 Level AA</a> (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">World Wide Web Consortium</a>). This means proper headings, alt text on images, captions on videos, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and accessible forms. See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full WCAG 2.1 specification</a> for complete technical requirements.

5. **Start small, start now:** You don't have to fix everything today. Focus on new content first, then prioritize high-traffic pages and critical services. Every small improvement counts.

6. **Help is available:** This FAQ, your agency's accessibility coordinator, <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT accessibility training</a>, and free tools like <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE</a> and <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe DevTools</a> can guide you through the process.

**More people need accessible content than you might expect:**

- **In Illinois alone:** Approximately **1.3 million adults** (12.6% of the adult population) have a disability that may affect how they access digital content — including mobility, cognitive, hearing, and vision impairments (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/impacts/illinois.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC Disability & Health Data</a>).
- **Beyond Illinois:** ICJIA's research, publications, and resources reach a **national and global audience** — researchers, policymakers, criminal justice professionals, and the public. Accessibility isn't just a state compliance issue; it determines who can access your work worldwide.
- **Temporary and situational disabilities count too:** A broken arm, recovery from surgery, bright sunlight on a screen, or aging-related vision changes — accessible content helps everyone at some point.

**What to do next:**

- Use the Quick Reference checklists below to start with high-impact actions for your role
- Use this FAQ like a reference — search for what you need when you need it

**Key takeaway:** Accessibility means people with disabilities can use your content. The work is manageable if you start now and focus on practical, high-impact actions.

## Understanding Accessibility

### What is digital accessibility?

**Quick answer:** Digital accessibility means everyone can use your digital content — websites, documents, videos, apps — regardless of disability.

**Full explanation:**

Digital accessibility means that websites, applications, documents, and other digital content are designed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, or alternative keyboards.

### What are additional benefits of accessible digital content (beyond compliance)?

{new:2026-01-01}

**Quick answer:** Accessible digital content is easier to **find**, **use**, and **reuse**. For websites, accessibility supports SEO and usability. For documents and media, it improves searchability, readability, and long-term maintainability.

**Full explanation:**

Accessible content — websites, documents, PDFs, and videos — provides measurable benefits beyond legal compliance.

**Websites:**

- **SEO + discoverability** — Clear headings, meaningful links, and text alternatives help search engines understand pages.
- **Usability** — Better keyboard support and structure reduces user friction for everyone, not just assistive tech users.
- **Maintainability** — Cleaner structure makes sites easier to update without breaking navigation or meaning.

**Documents + media (PDFs, Word, slides, video):**

- **Searchable and reusable** — Proper structure makes content searchable, copyable, and easier to repurpose.
- **Faster review** — Headings and consistent structure make long content easier to scan and navigate.
- **Operational resilience** — Accessible files work better across devices, tools, and workflows (including assistive tech).

**Key takeaway:** Accessibility is not “extra polish.” It improves quality and efficiency across web and content work — while also supporting compliance.

### How does digital accessibility and compliance fit into an agency's DEIA mission?

**Quick answer:** **Accessibility is the "A" in DEIA** — it's how we deliver **equitable access** to services and information by **removing systemic barriers** in our digital work. And it's not just an aspiration: it's backed by **accountability** through enforceable law (IITAA + ADA Title II) and a **measurable standard** (**WCAG 2.1 Level AA**) with a compliance deadline.

**Why this is central to DEIA (not separate from it):**

- **DEIA is about removing systemic barriers to participation** — inaccessible digital content is a barrier that can exclude people with disabilities from information, programs, and services.
- **Government is "digital by default" now** — if the front door is a website, PDF, online form, dashboard, or video, accessibility determines who can actually use the service.
- **Equity becomes measurable** — WCAG 2.1 Level AA turns "we want to be inclusive" into clear, testable expectations for digital equity.
- **Accountability is real** — this goes beyond individual accommodations. IITAA has required accessibility for years, and the ADA Title II web rule reinforces enforceable requirements for public-facing digital content.

**What this means in practice (the DEIA "translation" into daily work):**

1. **Publish accessibly by default** — headings, link text, alt text, captions, and readable structure are part of equitable communication.
2. **Design for everyone** — sufficient contrast, keyboard use, and clear language aren't "extras"; they determine who can participate.
3. **Procure responsibly** — requiring accessibility in contracts prevents inequity from being "outsourced" to inaccessible vendors/tools.
4. **Fix barriers when found** — treat accessibility issues like service issues, not just optional enhancements.
5. **Start now** — timelines and learning approaches can vary, but the obligation to provide accessible services does not.

**Key takeaway:** Accessibility is how DEIA commitments show up in the real world — **equitable access, with accountability** — and it's backed by federal and state compliance requirements (ADA Title II and IITAA) that make the "A" measurable and enforceable.

## Getting Started

### I'm a content creator. Where do I start?

**As a content creator, your role is crucial — you're often the first person to make content accessible (or inaccessible).** Here's your quickstart guide:

**Accessibility best practice:** When possible, publish content as webpage text (HTML) rather than PDFs. HTML webpages are generally easier to make and keep accessible than PDFs—especially when the alternative is a short webpage summary that links to a PDF that may or may not be accessible. As <a href="https://it.cornell.edu/accessibility/create-accessible-pdfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornell IT notes</a>, "Remediating PDFs for web accessibility can be more time consuming than creating a webpage. When possible, convert your PDFs to HTML web pages." The University of Illinois CITL PDF Accessibility Guide similarly notes that PDFs generally are not a very accessible format and recommends using PDFs only when no other alternative is available. This aligns with WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements and accessibility best practices.

**Visual example of accessible vs. inaccessible content:**

_Inaccessible approach:_ A webpage with two sentences and a link: "Our agency published its annual report. [Click here to download PDF]"

- Screen reader users hear: "Our agency published its annual report. Link: click here"
- Problem: No context about what the PDF contains, and the PDF itself may be inaccessible

_Accessible approach:_ Full report content published as webpage text with proper headings, alt text for images, and accessible tables

- Screen reader users can navigate by headings, read all content, and understand the full report
- Alternative: If PDF is necessary, provide both webpage summary AND accessible PDF with clear description

**Start here (15 minutes) — Essential skills everyone needs:**

1. **Alt text for images** — Write a brief description of what's in every image (think: "If I were describing this over the phone, what would I say?")
2. **Use heading styles** — In Word/PowerPoint, use the Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 styles instead of just making text bigger
3. **Write clear link text** — Instead of "click here," write "Download the 2025 Annual Report"
4. **Check color contrast** — Make sure text is dark enough to read against its background

**These four skills will address 60-70% of common accessibility issues.**

**Learn the details (30 minutes each):**

- **Alt text for images** — <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Alternative Text</a> — When to describe images vs. mark them as decorative.

- **W3C Course** — <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/web-accessibility/the-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-introduction-to-web-accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Introduction to Web Accessibility course</a> (self-paced, ~4 hours).

**The key mindset shift:** Think about how someone using a screen reader (software that reads content aloud) or keyboard navigation would experience your content. If they can't see images, colors, or mouse interactions, can they still understand and use your content? If not, you need to provide alternatives.

### I'm a web developer. Where do I start?

**As a developer, you're building the foundation that makes everything else possible.** Here's your roadmap:

**Week 1 priority (must-do):**

1. **Keyboard navigation** — Ensure everything works without a mouse: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility</a>
2. **Semantic HTML** — Use proper HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>` not `<div>`): <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C: Page Structure</a>
3. **Form labels** — Every form field needs a proper label: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Forms</a>
4. **Install testing tools** — Get axe DevTools or WAVE browser extensions running

**Core technical standards:**

- **WCAG Quick Reference** — <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference</a> — Filter by Level AA.
- **ARIA Authoring Practices** — <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C ARIA APG</a> (use semantic HTML first; ARIA second).
- **MDN Accessibility Guide** — <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla: Accessibility</a>.

**See also:** [How do I test my website for accessibility?](#website-accessibility-how-do-i-test-my-website-for-accessibility) | [What are the most common website accessibility issues?](#website-accessibility-what-are-the-most-common-website-accessibility-issues)

**Essential development practices:**

- **Focus management** — Visible focus indicators and logical tab order: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WCAG: Focus Visible</a>.
- **Automate what you can** — Add <a href="https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a> and use <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a> in CI/tests where feasible.

**ARIA usage specifics:**

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) should be used when semantic HTML isn't sufficient. Here's when and how:

**When to use ARIA:**

- **Dynamic content updates** — Use `aria-live` regions to announce changes (e.g., form validation messages, search results).
- **Complex widgets** — Use ARIA patterns for custom components (accordions, modals, tabs) that don't have native HTML equivalents.
- **Hidden content** — Use `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative elements that screen readers should skip.
- **Form relationships** — Use `aria-describedby` to link error messages to form fields.
- **Button states** — Use `aria-expanded` for collapsible content, `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons.

**ARIA best practices:**

1. **Prefer semantic HTML** — Use `<button>` not `<div role="button">`, `<nav>` not `<div role="navigation">`
2. **Don't change semantics** — Don't add ARIA that conflicts with native HTML (e.g., `role="button"` on a `<button>`)
3. **Test with screen readers** — ARIA that looks correct in code may not work as expected; always test
4. **Keep it simple** — If you can solve it with HTML, don't add ARIA

**Common ARIA patterns:**

- **Error messages:** `<input aria-describedby="error-id">` + `<div id="error-id" role="alert">Error text</div>`.
- **Skip links:** `<a href="#main" aria-label="Skip to main content">Skip to content</a>`.
- **Modal dialogs:** `role="dialog"` + `aria-labelledby` + `aria-modal="true"` + focus trap.
- **Progress indicators:** `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`.

**Resources:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide</a> — Complete patterns and examples
- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ARIA Patterns</a> — Specific widget patterns

**Testing tools (integrate into your workflow):**

- **Automated checks** — axe DevTools or WAVE (plus Lighthouse as a secondary signal).
- **Manual checks** — keyboard-only + at least one screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver): <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVDA download</a>.

**Deepen skills (optional):** <a href="https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev Learn Accessibility</a> and Illinois DoIT training: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html</a>

**Code review checklist (use this before every release):**

✓ Semantic HTML structure  
✓ Keyboard navigation works throughout  
✓ Focus indicators are visible  
✓ Color contrast meets 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text)  
✓ Images have alt text (or are marked decorative)  
✓ Forms have proper labels and error messages  
✓ ARIA is used correctly (or semantic HTML is preferred)  
✓ Automated tests pass (axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse)

**The key mindset:** Build accessibility in from the start, not as an afterthought. It's much easier and cheaper than retrofitting later. Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers regularly, not just at the end.

### I'm a manager. Where do I start?

**As a manager, your role is to create the organizational conditions for accessibility success.** You don't need to become a technical expert — you need to set priorities, fund time/tools, and create accountability.

**Manager quick checklist (start here):**

1. **Name an owner** (or coordinator) for accessibility work and reporting
2. **Inventory what you publish** (sites, forms, PDFs, videos, social posts, vendor tools)
3. **Prioritize by impact** (high-traffic + high-stakes services first)
4. **Bake accessibility into process** (before publish / before purchase / before launch)
5. **Track progress** to the deadline (clear milestones, regular check-ins)

**1. Understand the compliance requirements and timeline:**

- **The deadline is firm** — April 24, 2026 for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.
- **It applies to everything** — Websites, documents, videos, social media, mobile apps.
- **It's a compliance requirement** — ADA Title II and IITAA set enforceable expectations.
- **Read the basics** — <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a> — Plain language summary of requirements.
- **Primary source (final rule text)** — <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/24/2024-07758/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-disability-accessibility-of-web-information-and-services-of-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Register: ADA Title II Web Rule (April 24, 2024)</a>.

**2. Assess your current state:**

- **Audit existing content** — Identify all public-facing digital content (websites, documents, videos, social media).
- **Prioritize by impact** — Focus on high-traffic pages, frequently accessed documents, and critical services first.
- **Identify gaps** — Use automated tools and manual testing to find accessibility issues.
- **Estimate remediation effort** — Understand the scope of work needed.

**3. Build accessibility into your processes:**

- **Include accessibility in project timelines** — Don't treat it as an add-on; build it into initial project plans.
- **Require accessibility in procurement** — Include WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements in RFPs and vendor contracts.
- **Establish content review processes** — Ensure documents and content are checked for accessibility before publication.
- **Create accessibility checkpoints** — Build accessibility reviews into your content approval workflows.

**4. Allocate resources strategically:**

- **Training budget** — Invest in accessibility training for content creators, developers, and designers.
- **Tools and software** — Provide accessibility testing tools (WAVE, axe DevTools, PDF accessibility checkers).
- **Time allocation** — Recognize that creating accessible content may take slightly longer initially.
- **Expert support** — Consider accessibility consultants or specialists for complex projects.

**5. Support your team:**

- **Make it a priority** — Communicate that accessibility is important and expected.
- **Remove barriers** — Ensure staff have access to training, tools, and time needed.
- **Celebrate progress** — Recognize teams and individuals who successfully implement accessibility.
- **Learn alongside your team** — Attend training sessions to understand what your team is learning.

**6. Establish accountability:**

- **Assign responsibilities** — Clearly define who is responsible for accessibility in each area.
- **Set expectations** — Make accessibility part of job descriptions and performance expectations.
- **Track progress** — Monitor compliance status and remediation efforts.
- **Regular check-ins** — Include accessibility in regular team meetings and project reviews.

**7. Connect with resources:**

- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — Email: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov — Website: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/</a>.
- **Accessibility coordinators** — Identify or designate an accessibility coordinator in your organization.
- **Peer networks** — Connect with other managers facing similar challenges.
- **Legal/compliance team** — Work with your legal or compliance office to understand requirements.

**8. Keep it sustainable (so it doesn't collapse after one push):**

- Build accessibility into ongoing operations (publish + purchase + build), not a one-time project
- Maintain documentation, milestones, and ownership

**Key takeaway:** As a manager, you don't need to become a technical expert, but you do need to create the organizational support, resources, and accountability that enable your team to succeed. The April 2026 deadline is firm, but with proper planning and support, your organization can achieve compliance.

### I'm on executive staff. Where do I start?

**As executive staff, your role is to make accessibility achievable at scale.** You don't need to be the technical expert; you need to ensure there is clear ownership, adequate resourcing, enforceable process, and consistent reporting through April 2026 and beyond.

**Executive quick checklist (start here):**

1. **Designate an accessibility coordinator** with authority to coordinate across departments and report progress
2. **Adopt an agency accessibility policy** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA, scope, timelines, enforcement)
3. **Fund training and tools** (documents, web, video, procurement) and allocate staff time for remediation
4. **Require accessibility in procurement** (WCAG requirements in contracts; review VPAT/ACR; remediation commitments)
5. **Establish reporting** (inventory → prioritized backlog → milestones → risks → monthly/quarterly updates)

**What "good" looks like (practical, defensible):**

- **Inventory exists** for public-facing websites, documents/PDFs, forms, videos, social, mobile apps, and third-party tools
- **Priorities are explicit** (high-traffic + high-stakes services first; complete blockers first)
- **A remediation plan exists** with milestones through April 24, 2026 (and owners for each track)
- **Evidence is retained** (audit outputs, remediation logs, training completion, procurement language, vendor correspondence)
- **Escalation path is clear** for tradeoffs (what gets fixed first when time/budget conflicts arise)

**Key actions you can take this week (high impact):**

- Ask for a **top 10 risks list** (complete blockers, critical services, high-traffic issues)
- Require a **monthly progress dashboard** (what changed since last month + what's next)
- Direct procurement to **standardize accessibility language** and a **review gate** before purchase/renewal

### What exactly am I accountable for as a manager (vs. what my team is accountable for)?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** You're accountable for **making accessibility possible and expected**: ownership, priorities, time/tools/training, and accountability. Your team is accountable for **creating and maintaining accessible content and systems** in their day-to-day work.

**Manager accountabilities (what you control):**

- **Ownership** — Name a coordinator/owner and make reporting routine.
- **Resourcing** — Allocate time, tools, and training (and remove blockers).
- **Process** — Require accessibility checks before publish/purchase/launch.
- **Accountability** — Define responsibilities clearly and track progress to the deadline.

**Team accountabilities (what they do):**

- **Content creators** — headings, link text, alt text, accessible documents, captions/transcripts.
- **Developers/IT** — accessible code, testing, fixing defects, vendor integration requirements.
- **Procurement/program teams** — require WCAG 2.1 AA and review VPAT/ACRs before purchase.

**Helpful framing:** Accessibility is a compliance deliverable like security and privacy — it needs ownership, a plan, and execution across roles.

### How can I track and demonstrate "good-faith progress" toward compliance?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** Maintain a clear inventory, a prioritized backlog, and evidence of steady progress (what was fixed, when, and what's next).

**Practical manager artifacts (simple, defensible):**

1. **Inventory** of public-facing content/tools (web, PDFs, forms, videos, social, vendor tools)
2. **Prioritized backlog** (top services + top traffic + complete blockers first)
3. **Milestones** (monthly/quarterly targets through April 2026)
4. **Evidence** (audit results, remediation logs, training completion, procurement language)
5. **Escalation path** (who decides tradeoffs when priorities conflict)

**Why this helps:** It prevents "we didn't know" and gives leadership a concrete way to support resourcing decisions.

### Who signs off that we're compliant? Can we "certify" WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance?

{new:2026-01-02}

**Quick answer:** There is no single official "WCAG certificate" you can buy that guarantees compliance. **Compliance is demonstrated by meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA success criteria across the defined scope of your digital content.** If you choose to make a formal statement, WCAG defines how to make a **conformance claim** — and it's **optional**.

**Full explanation:**

- **WCAG is a standard, not a licensing program.** Organizations can evaluate their websites/apps against WCAG and document results, but WCAG itself does not create a "certified by W3C" program.
- **Conformance claims are optional and scoped.** WCAG allows you to publish a conformance claim (for one page, a set of pages, or a set of related pages), but the claim must include required components and clearly define scope and level.
- **In practice, "sign-off" is an internal governance decision.** For agencies, the defensible approach is to require a written scope (what's included), the target level (WCAG 2.1 AA), and evidence (test results + remediation record), then have the appropriate leadership/compliance owners approve the risk posture.

**What to do (manager-friendly, defensible):**

1. **Define scope** (which sites/apps/pages and which time period/content types).
2. **Use a recognized evaluation methodology** and retain the report.
3. **Record known issues + remediation plan** (including vendor/tool dependencies).
4. **Document who approved** the scope and the plan (so "sign-off" is real).

## Common Concerns

### Why does accessibility compliance require everyone's participation?

**Because web developers can only fix technical issues — they can't fix content.**

While web developers handle technical implementation (code structure, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes that help screen readers understand interactive elements), they **cannot** fix content created by others. Achieving compliance requires:

- **Content creators** — Write alt text for images, use proper heading styles, make documents accessible, add captions to videos.
- **Designers** — Ensure color contrast meets requirements, design with keyboard navigation in mind.
- **Procurement staff** — Include accessibility requirements in contracts for third-party tools.
- **Web developers** — Implement technical accessibility standards, test with assistive technologies.
- **Project managers** — Include accessibility in timelines and ensure it's addressed from project start.
- **Leadership** — Allocate time, budget, and resources.

**Example:** If you create a PDF report, the web team cannot add alt text to your images, fix your heading structure, or make your tables accessible. Those are content decisions only you can make as the document creator.

**The cost of waiting:** Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically **significantly more expensive** than building accessibility in from the start—industry estimates suggest remediation costs can be several times higher than proactive design.

### Can managers delay accessibility work to "get more information first"?

**The April 24, 2026 deadline is a fixed compliance requirement under the ADA Title II web rule.** The rule does not include a routine extension process. While it's completely reasonable for managers to want clarity on scope, timeline, and resources before starting work, the deadline is firm — accessibility work needs to begin now, even as you gather more information.

**Who to ask (so you get answers without losing time):**

- **Your web developers** — Web teams have been working on accessibility for years and can share practical guidance on common barriers, testing, and what “good” looks like. They write code (not your documents), but they’re often the best starting point for accessibility questions in general — especially as timelines get tight.
- **Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility** — Best source for questions about the **specific compliance requirements** (IITAA + ADA Title II), timelines, and state guidance: DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov.

**What managers can do:**

- **Ask questions** — Understand what accessibility means for your team's work.
- **Clarify scope** — Get a clear picture of what needs to be done.
- **Plan resources** — Allocate time and budget needed for compliance.
- **Prioritize work** — Determine what needs to be done first.
- **Learn while doing** — Start the work now and adjust plans as you gain understanding.

**What managers cannot do:**

- **Delay the work** — The deadline is firm (the rule does not include a routine extension process).
- **Treat it as optional** — It's a compliance requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA, not a "nice to have".
- **Push it to "later"** — Waiting makes the work more expensive and increases legal risk.

**The reality:** Waiting until you fully understand everything will only make compliance harder to achieve. The best approach is to start the work now, ask questions along the way, and adjust plans as you gain more understanding.

### I'm already overloaded — how am I supposed to add accessibility to my workload?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Accessibility isn't additional work on top of your job — it's a change in _how_ you do work you're already doing. Creating an accessible document takes only a few extra minutes once you know the basics.

**Full explanation:**

**We hear you.** Everyone is busy, and "one more thing" feels impossible. But here's the reframe: you're already creating documents, adding images, and publishing content. Accessibility is about doing those things _slightly differently_ — not doing more things.

**The real time investment:**

| Task                                                       | Extra Time    | Notes                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adding alt text to an image                                | 30 seconds    | You know what's in the image — just describe it           |
| Using heading styles instead of bold                       | 0 seconds     | Same number of clicks, different button                   |
| Writing "Download the 2025 Report" instead of "Click here" | 5 seconds     | Better for everyone, not just accessibility               |
| Running the Accessibility Checker in Word                  | 60 seconds    | Built into Microsoft Office — one click                   |
| Adding captions to a 5-minute video                        | 10-15 minutes | This one does take time (but is a compliance requirement) |

**What actually takes time:**

- **Remediating old content** — Yes, this is real work. Prioritize by impact and chip away at it.
- **Learning the basics** — About 15-30 minutes to learn the essentials. Do it once, apply forever.
- **Complex documents** — Tables, forms, and multi-column layouts require more attention.

**What to tell your manager:**

If you genuinely don't have bandwidth, escalate it. Say: _"Accessibility is a compliance requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA. I need either (a) time allocated for training and remediation, or (b) clarity on what gets deprioritized to make room for this."_

**The reality:** Accessibility is a compliance requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA. Managers also need to allocate realistic time and resources for staff to learn and implement accessibility practices. If you're genuinely overloaded, the best next step is to work with your manager to prioritize and allocate time appropriately.

**Start small:**

1. Learn one thing this week (alt text is the easiest)
2. Apply it to everything you create going forward
3. Add another skill next week

**Key takeaway:** You don't have to fix everything at once. But you do have to start — and starting is smaller than you think.

### Who is affected by inaccessible digital content?

**Quick answer:** Illinois residents with disabilities — including vision, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments — require accessible digital content to access government services. The <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA)</a>, overseen by Illinois DoIT, requires that all state agency digital content be accessible to people with disabilities.

**Full explanation:**

**Illinois residents with disabilities need accessible digital content.** The IITAA has required accessible digital content since 2008, and Illinois DoIT provides guidance and oversight for state agencies to ensure compliance.

When digital content isn't accessible, agencies exclude Illinois residents with disabilities from accessing government information and services. Common disabilities include:

- **Vision impairments** — Blindness, low vision, color blindness.
- **Hearing impairments** — Deafness, hearing loss.
- **Motor disabilities** — Difficulty using a mouse, limited hand mobility.
- **Cognitive disabilities** — Learning disabilities, memory difficulties, attention disorders.

**Why this matters:** Accessible digital content isn't just about legal compliance — it's about ensuring equal access to government services for Illinois residents with disabilities, as required by IITAA.

### What is WCAG?

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** are international standards that explain how to make digital content accessible to people with disabilities. Think of them as a detailed checklist for making websites, documents, and apps usable by everyone.

WCAG is organized around four principles, known as **POUR**:

- **Perceivable** — People must be able to see or hear content (or have it described by assistive technology). Example: Images need text descriptions for people who can't see them.
- **Operable** — People must be able to use interface components and navigate content. Example: Everything that works with a mouse must also work with a keyboard.
- **Understandable** — Content and how to use it must be clear. Example: Error messages should explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **Robust** — Content must work with different technologies, including assistive tools like screen readers. Example: Use standard HTML so assistive technologies can interpret the content.

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C: Accessibility Principles</a> — Detailed explanation of POUR principles

### What does "WCAG 2.1 Level AA" mean?

WCAG has three conformance levels:

- **Level A** — Minimum accessibility (must meet).
- **Level AA** — Standard accessibility (should meet) ← _Required for Illinois_.
- **Level AAA** — Enhanced accessibility (may meet where feasible).

Illinois requires Level AA conformance, which includes all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

**Note about WCAG versions:** WCAG 2.2 was published in October 2023 and adds additional success criteria. However, the ADA Title II rule specifically requires WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Content that meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA is compliant with current federal requirements. WCAG versions are backward-compatible, so meeting 2.2 also means meeting 2.1 and 2.0.

### Isn't accessibility just an IT issue? Shouldn't the web team fix all these issues?

**No. Accessibility is an organization-wide responsibility.** IT and web teams can fix technical barriers, but they can’t retroactively “repair” inaccessible content, designs, or procurement decisions without rework.

**Who owns what (high-level):**

- **Content creators**: headings, link text, alt text, accessible documents, captions/transcripts.
- **Designers**: contrast, focus visibility, layouts that work with keyboard/screen readers.
- **Procurement/program teams**: require WCAG 2.1 Level AA in contracts; avoid buying inaccessible tools.
- **Web/IT**: accessible code, testing, fixes, platform configuration.
- **Managers/leaders**: time, tools, training, accountability.

**Why waiting for "IT will fix it later" doesn't work:**

- Accessibility is cheapest when done early; retrofits can be **significantly more expensive**—industry estimates suggest remediation costs can be several times higher than proactive design.
- A PDF without headings/alt text, a low-contrast design, or an inaccessible vendor tool can’t be “patched” by IT without changing the original work.

**Best practice:** Plan for accessibility early — address it in **content + design + procurement + build** from the start, not at the end. (This is sometimes called "shifting left" in project management terminology.)

### I prefer formal DoIT presentations instead of this FAQ. When will those be available?

{new:2025-12-28}

**Quick answer:** That makes sense — formal presentations with Q&A can be valuable. ICJIA is actively working with DoIT to schedule formal accessibility presentations in the upcoming weeks. However, with {days_until_deadline} days until the April 24, 2026 deadline, please don't wait to start accessibility work. Begin using the role-specific guidance below while presentations are being scheduled.

**Presentations are coming:**

ICJIA is coordinating with the Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility to schedule formal presentations for staff. These will provide an opportunity for Q&A, clarification, and agency-specific guidance. Watch for announcements from executive staff or your accessibility coordinator.

**In the meantime, start today based on your role:**

**If you're executive staff:**
1. **Designate an accessibility coordinator** — This is your most urgent action. The coordinator can then work with DoIT to arrange appropriate presentations and training.
2. **Allocate resources** — Budget for accessibility tools, training, and staff time. This work requires dedicated resources.
3. **Set agency-wide expectations** — Make clear that accessibility is a priority and all staff should begin using available resources now.
4. **Review high-visibility content** — Identify your agency's most public-facing content (main website, key publications) and ensure it's prioritized for accessibility work.

**If you're a manager:**
1. **Review staff responsibilities** — Identify who creates content, manages websites, or produces documents in your unit.
2. **Direct staff to this FAQ** — Specifically point staff to role-based guidance: [Content creators](#getting-started-i-m-a-content-creator-where-do-i-start) | [Web developers](#getting-started-i-m-a-web-developer-where-do-i-start)
3. **Build accessibility into workflows** — Add accessibility checks to content approval processes now, not later.
4. **Inventory your content** — Identify what needs remediation (websites, PDFs, videos, social media) so you understand the scope.

**If you're a content creator:**
1. **Fix the basics in new content** — Add alt text to images, use heading styles, write descriptive links, check color contrast, caption videos.
2. **Review recent work** — Go back and fix accessibility issues in content you've created in the past 6-12 months.
3. **Use available tools** — Many are free (see [What are the most common accessibility mistakes to avoid?](#common-concerns-what-are-the-most-common-accessibility-mistakes-to-avoid)).
4. **Document your questions** — Note what's unclear so you can ask during a future presentation, but don't delay fixable work.

**If you're a web developer:**
1. **Run automated tests** — Use free tools (axe DevTools, WAVE, Lighthouse) to identify issues immediately.
2. **Fix common code issues** — Missing alt text, poor heading structure, insufficient color contrast, missing ARIA labels.
3. **Review form accessibility** — Ensure all form inputs have proper labels and error messages.
4. **Test with keyboard only** — Verify all functionality works without a mouse.

**About the upcoming DoIT presentations:**

- **ICJIA is scheduling them now** — We're actively working with DoIT to bring formal presentations to ICJIA staff. Watch for announcements.
- **They'll complement this FAQ** — Presentations will provide live Q&A, clarification, and opportunities to discuss agency-specific situations. This FAQ provides the reference material you can use before and after.
- **The fundamentals are the same** — The presentations will cover the same core requirements documented here (alt text, captions, keyboard access, color contrast). Starting now means you'll be better prepared for the presentations.

**What you're not waiting for:**

- **Permission to start** — These are legal requirements with a fixed deadline. You have authority to begin compliance work now.
- **Specialized knowledge** — The most common fixes (alt text, heading structure, descriptive links) are straightforward and covered in these FAQs.
- **Perfect understanding** — You can address clear violations now and ask questions about edge cases later.

**Reality check on timing:**

- **The remaining {days_until_deadline} days is limited time** — There is no one-click fix for accessibility. The work requires manual remediation: reviewing every image, document, video, and web page.
- **Presentations don't speed up the work** — A presentation may clarify requirements, but the actual remediation still takes the same amount of time.
- **The deadline is the same for everyone** — April 24, 2026 applies regardless of when your agency receives training.

**Practical next steps:**

1. **Start with high-impact, low-effort fixes** — Alt text, descriptive links, heading structure, color contrast.
2. **Use existing resources** — The links in these FAQs are the same ones DoIT will reference.
3. **Document your progress** — Track what's been fixed so you can demonstrate progress.
4. **Note your questions** — Keep a list of unclear items to address in future presentations.
5. **Contact DoIT for urgent questions** — Email DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov for specific guidance, but don't delay obvious fixes.

### What are the most common accessibility mistakes to avoid?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Most accessibility issues come from a small set of common mistakes. Avoid these 10 things and you'll prevent the majority of accessibility problems.

**Top 10 accessibility mistakes (and what to do instead):**

| ❌ Don't do this                                                                            | ✅ Do this instead                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Skip alt text on images** — "The image is self-explanatory"                            | Write alt text for every image. If you took the photo for a reason, that reason needs words.           |
| **2. Use "Click here" or "Read more" for links** — Screen readers read links out of context | Write descriptive links: "Download the 2025 Annual Report" or "View training schedule"                 |
| **3. Make text bold instead of using heading styles** — Looks like a heading but isn't one  | Use Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 styles. Screen readers use headings to navigate.                   |
| **4. Put essential info only in images** — Images may not load or be visible                | Always include the same information as text in the document or caption                                 |
| **5. Use color alone to convey meaning** — "Required fields are in red"                     | Use text labels, icons, or patterns in addition to color                                               |
| **6. Create PDFs by scanning paper** — Results in an image, not readable text               | Use OCR or create documents digitally with proper structure                                            |
| **7. Skip captions on videos** — "People can figure it out"                                 | Always add captions. It's a compliance requirement and benefits everyone.                              |
| **8. Use tiny or low-contrast text** — Light gray on white, small fonts                     | Use at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text; avoid very small text sizes that reduce readability |
| **9. Build complex tables with merged cells** — Screen readers can't interpret them         | Use simple tables with clear headers; avoid merging cells when possible                                |
| **10. Assume "IT will fix it later"** — Accessibility is everyone's job                     | Make accessibility part of your workflow from the start                                                |

**Bonus mistakes to avoid:**

- **Autoplaying audio or video** — Always give users control.
- **Removing focus indicators** — The blue outline helps keyboard users know where they are.
- **Using placeholder text as labels** — Placeholder text disappears when you start typing.
- **Making clickable areas too small** — For usability, aim for touch targets of at least 44x44 pixels (this is strongly recommended best practice, though not strictly required by WCAG 2.1 Level AA).
- **Flashing or blinking content** — Can trigger seizures; as a safe rule, avoid any flashing content entirely, or ensure nothing flashes more than 3 times in any one-second period.

**Key takeaway:** Most accessibility issues aren't complicated — they're just habits we haven't formed yet. Avoid these common mistakes and you'll address the majority of accessibility barriers.

**Quick self-check:** Before publishing any content, ask yourself:

1. Does every image have alt text?
2. Are my links descriptive?
3. Did I use heading styles (not just bold)?
4. Can I understand the content without seeing colors?
5. Do my videos have captions?

If you can answer "yes" to all five, you've avoided the most common problems.

## State Agency Applicability

### Do we need an agency accessibility coordinator?

{new:2025-12-28}

**Quick answer:** Yes, you need an accessibility coordinator. Neither web developers nor content creators can serve as the coordinator because: (1) accessibility covers websites, documents, videos, social media, mobile apps, and third-party tools — no single practitioner role has visibility across all of these; (2) practitioners are busy doing the actual compliance work; (3) accessibility requires organizational policy and resource allocation decisions that practitioners typically can't make. The coordinator should be someone in executive, compliance, or management roles.

**Why a web developer can't be the coordinator:**

- **Limited scope** — Web developers focus on websites and web applications. Accessibility compliance also covers documents, videos, social media, mobile apps, and third-party tools — areas outside their direct responsibility.
- **Busy doing the work** — Web developers are actively implementing accessibility standards, fixing issues, and testing websites. They're doing the technical compliance work, not coordinating organizational strategy.
- **No organizational authority** — Web developers typically don't set agency-wide policy, allocate budgets, or direct other teams. They implement solutions; they don't make resource decisions.
- **Not positioned to report to leadership** — Coordinators report compliance status, risks, and progress to executive staff. Web developers work within technical teams, not at the strategic leadership level.

**Why a content creator can't be the coordinator:**

- **Limited scope** — Content creators focus on documents, PDFs, presentations, and written content. Accessibility compliance also covers websites, mobile apps, social media, videos, and third-party vendor tools — areas outside their direct responsibility.
- **Busy doing the work** — Content creators are actively remediating documents, adding alt text, creating accessible PDFs, and producing content. They're doing the actual accessibility work, not coordinating organizational strategy.
- **No organizational authority** — Content creators typically don't set agency-wide policy, approve budgets, or direct other departments. They create content; they don't make resource allocation decisions.
- **Not positioned to coordinate across departments** — The coordinator needs to work with IT, communications, legal, procurement, and executive staff. Content creators work within their units, not across the organization.

**The scope is bigger than any single practitioner role:**

- **Websites** — Web developers' domain, but only one part of compliance.
- **Documents** — Content creators' domain (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint).
- **Videos** — Captions, transcripts (content creators and communications teams).
- **Social media** — Accessible posts, alt text, captions (communications teams).
- **Mobile apps** — If your agency has apps, they need accessibility too.
- **Third-party tools** — Procurement decisions, vendor requirements (procurement/legal teams).

No single practitioner has visibility across all of these areas. The coordinator needs to see the full picture.

**Accessibility requires organizational authority:**

- **Policy decisions** — Setting accessibility standards, priorities, and processes agency-wide.
- **Resource allocation** — Approving budgets, training, tools, and time allocation.
- **Cross-department coordination** — Working with IT, communications, legal, procurement, and content teams.
- **Strategic reporting** — Reporting compliance status, risks, and progress to executive staff.

Neither web developers nor content creators typically have this organizational authority — they're practitioners, not policy setters.

**What the coordinator does:**

The accessibility coordinator needs to:

- **Set organizational policy** — Make decisions about accessibility standards, priorities, and processes that apply agency-wide.
- **Allocate resources** — Approve budgets, training, tools, and time allocation for accessibility work.
- **Coordinate with technical teams** — Meet with and talk to web developers and content creators who are currently involved in accessibility compliance work. These teams are busy doing the actual compliance work, so the coordinator should gather information from them and report back to executive staff about progress, challenges, and resource needs.
- **Report to executive staff** — Provide updates on compliance status, risks, and progress to leadership.

**Who should be the coordinator:**

The accessibility coordinator should be someone who has organizational authority (often in executive, compliance, or management roles) and can:

- Make policy decisions and allocate resources.
- Understand the full scope (websites, documents, videos, social media, mobile apps, third-party tools).
- Coordinate across departments (IT, communications, legal, procurement, content teams).
- Report to executive staff with strategic recommendations.

**Common coordinator roles:** Compliance officer, IT director/manager, communications director, program manager, or executive staff member.

**The key distinction:**

- **Accessibility coordinator** = Sets policy, allocates resources, makes strategic decisions, coordinates with technical teams, reports to executive staff (needs organizational authority).
- **Web developers and content creators** = Provide technical expertise, implement solutions, do the actual compliance work (valuable resources, but typically not policy setters).

**Bottom line:** Yes, you need an accessibility coordinator — and neither web developers nor content creators can fill this role. Both are essential practitioners doing the actual compliance work, but they lack the organizational authority, cross-departmental visibility, and strategic positioning the coordinator role requires. The coordinator should be someone in executive, compliance, or management roles who can set policy, allocate resources, coordinate across departments, and report to leadership — while relying on web developers and content creators as the technical experts who get the work done.

### Why does your agency need to worry about digital accessibility? What does the April 2026 deadline mean?

**As an Illinois state agency, your agency must comply with both state and federal accessibility requirements (IITAA and ADA Title II) to ensure digital content is accessible.** The April 24, 2026 compliance deadline is a legal requirement — it applies directly to all Illinois state agencies.

**Why this matters for Illinois state agencies:**

1. **State agency status** — Illinois state agencies fall under the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA), which has required accessible digital content since 2008. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 24, 2024) require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

2. **Public service mission** — State agencies provide information, research, and resources to Illinois residents. Under ADA Title II, all public-facing digital content must be accessible to people with disabilities.

3. **Illinois residents with disabilities need accessible digital content** — The <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA)</a>, overseen by Illinois DoIT, requires that all state agency digital content be accessible to people with disabilities. Common disabilities include mobility limitations, cognitive difficulties, hearing difficulties, and vision impairment. Illinois residents with disabilities rely on accessible digital content to access government services and information. When state agency websites or documents aren't accessible, we're excluding Illinois residents with disabilities from critical government information and resources.

4. **Federal funding** — Many Illinois state agencies receive federal grants. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that any organization receiving federal funding ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities.

5. **The April 2026 deadline is firm** — The U.S. Department of Justice's ADA Title II web accessibility rule (published April 24, 2024) requires state and local governments with populations of 50,000 or more to achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance by **April 24, 2026**. Illinois has over 12 million residents, so this deadline applies to all state agencies.

**The reality of digital accessibility now:**

Accessibility is no longer just "best practice" — it's a compliance requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA. The 2026 deadline creates accountability for what has always been the right thing to do. For state agencies, this means integrating accessibility into every aspect of your digital presence: websites, documents, social media, and any tools you provide to the public.

**The good news:** Many accessibility improvements also benefit everyone — clearer content, better-organized documents, and more usable websites make information easier to find and understand for all users.

### If this has been a requirement, why hasn't your agency been doing this all along?

**Two things can be true at once:**

1. **Many agency web teams have been building accessible websites for years.** This isn’t “brand new” work for developers.
2. **The 2026 deadline changes who needs to participate.** Compliance now depends on _everyone who publishes digital content_, not just the web team.

**What the web team owns vs. what content teams own:**

- **Web team (website accessibility):** code structure, navigation, forms, keyboard support, ARIA where needed
- **Content creators (content accessibility):** accessible documents (Word/PDF/PowerPoint/Excel), image alt text, captions/transcripts, social media accessibility

**Why it feels different now:**

- **Accountability is stronger** — ADA Title II now points to a measurable standard (**WCAG 2.1 Level AA**) with a firm compliance deadline.
- **Scope is broader** — accessibility applies across websites _and_ documents, multimedia, social media, and third-party tools used to deliver services.

**Key takeaway:** Developers can’t make your PDFs accessible for you, and they can’t caption your videos after the fact. The standard is the same, but the work is spread across roles — and the deadline makes that shared responsibility unavoidable.

### What happens after April 24, 2026?

**Quick answer:** After April 24, 2026, all public-facing digital content from state and local governments must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Agencies that don't comply risk DOJ investigations, lawsuits, legal costs, and — most importantly — excluding people with disabilities from accessing government services.

**Full explanation:**

**After April 24, 2026, state and local governments must be in compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for all public-facing digital content.** Agencies that fail to meet this deadline may face several potential issues:

**Legal and enforcement consequences:**

- **Department of Justice investigations** — The DOJ can investigate complaints and pursue enforcement actions against non-compliant agencies.
- **Complaints and lawsuits** — Individuals with disabilities can file complaints with the DOJ or pursue private lawsuits under the ADA.
- **Legal costs and remediation expenses** — Agencies may face significant costs for legal defense, settlements, and emergency remediation of inaccessible content.
- **Reputational harm** — Public awareness of accessibility failures can damage an agency's reputation and public trust.

**What this means for you personally:**

While enforcement is typically at the agency level, individuals may experience:

- **Required remediation** — You may be asked to fix inaccessible content you created.
- **Mandatory training** — Staff who create inaccessible content may be required to complete accessibility training.
- **Performance expectations** — Accessibility compliance may become part of job responsibilities and performance evaluations.
- **Increased workload** — Emergency remediation is stressful and time-consuming; building accessibility in from the start prevents this.

**Operational impacts:**

- **Service disruptions** — If complaints or lawsuits result in court orders, agencies may need to temporarily remove or restrict access to non-compliant content.
- **Resource reallocation** — Emergency remediation efforts can divert staff time and budget from other priorities.
- **Delayed projects** — New digital projects may be delayed while existing accessibility issues are addressed.
- **Increased scrutiny** — Agencies with known accessibility issues may face increased oversight and reporting requirements.

**The bottom line:** If it's digital and public-facing, it needs to be accessible by April 24, 2026. Agencies that start working toward compliance now have time to address issues systematically. Those that delay may face costly emergency remediation and legal consequences.

### After April 24, 2026, how do we maintain compliance (so we don’t fall out of compliance again)?

{new:2026-01-02}

**Quick answer:** Treat accessibility like **security and privacy**: it’s not a one-time remediation project. Maintaining compliance means building accessibility into **every publish/purchase/build workflow**, continuously testing, fixing regressions, and keeping documentation current.

**Full explanation:**

After the deadline, agencies will still:

- **Publish new content every week** (web pages, PDFs, forms, videos, social posts)
- **Change designs and features** (which can introduce new accessibility issues)
- **Renew or adopt vendor tools** (which can create new barriers if not evaluated and monitored)

If accessibility is treated as a one-time “cleanup,” it will erode quickly. A sustainable approach is an ongoing program:

- **Bake accessibility into workflows** (before publish / before purchase / before launch)
- **Test continuously** (automated + manual; tools help, but human evaluation is required)
- **Monitor and remediate** (track issues like any operational risk)
- **Train and refresh training** (new staff and new tools create predictable drift)

**What to do (minimum viable maintenance plan):**

1. **Set a recurring testing cadence** (monthly/quarterly) for high-traffic and high-stakes services.
2. **Add accessibility gates** to CMS publishing, procurement/renewals, and releases.
3. **Track regressions** (known issues, fixes, and re-tests) in a backlog with owners.
4. **Maintain an “accessibility contact” and response process** for reports/complaints.

### What if we can't meet the April 24, 2026 deadline?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** The deadline is a firm compliance requirement, not a target. If your agency can't achieve full compliance by April 24, 2026, you should still make as much progress as possible while documenting your remediation plan and prioritizing high-impact content.

**Full explanation:**

**The April 24, 2026 deadline is a firm compliance requirement under the ADA Title II web accessibility rule.** The rule does not include a routine extension process, and non-compliance exposes agencies to enforcement actions, complaints, and lawsuits.

**However, the reality is that some agencies may not achieve 100% compliance by the deadline.** If that’s your situation, the goal is to reduce barriers as quickly as possible, document your plan, and keep improving.

**1. Prioritize by impact:**

- Focus on high-traffic pages and documents first
- Address critical services that residents depend on
- Fix barriers that completely block access before cosmetic issues

**2. Document your remediation efforts:**

- Keep records of what you've fixed and when
- Maintain a prioritized backlog of remaining issues
- Show a clear timeline and plan for ongoing remediation

**3. Provide accessible alternatives:**

- If a document can't be remediated in time, provide an accessible alternative upon request
- Ensure contact information is available for accommodation requests
- Respond promptly to accessibility complaints

**4. Continue progress after the deadline:**

- The obligation doesn't end at the deadline — you must still work toward full compliance
- Demonstrating good-faith efforts matters if complaints are filed

**Common pitfalls to avoid:**

- Avoid “we can’t make it anyway, so we’ll stop” — that approach tends to increase risk and harm users
- Avoid waiting for “perfect” — meaningful progress is better than paralysis
- Avoid assuming it won’t be enforced — planning as if it matters is the safer posture

**Key takeaway:** If you miss the deadline, keep making progress. Agencies should reduce barriers quickly, document their efforts, provide alternatives, and continue working toward full compliance. Good-faith efforts and documented progress can matter in enforcement contexts, especially when paired with real, ongoing remediation.

### How do we prioritize accessibility work with limited resources and a ticking clock?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Start with the highest-impact content — what the most people need, for the most critical services. Don't try to fix everything at once; focus on removing the biggest barriers first.

**Full explanation:**

**When time and resources are limited, strategic prioritization is essential.** Here's a practical framework agencies like yours can use:

**Tier 1: Fix First (Highest Impact)**

- **Critical services** — Applications, forms, and information people need to access benefits, report issues, or fulfill program requirements.
- **High-traffic pages** — Your homepage, main navigation, and most-visited content.
- **Complete blockers** — Issues that prevent access entirely (missing form labels, inaccessible login, no keyboard navigation).
- **New content** — Stop creating new barriers; make all new content accessible immediately.

**Tier 2: Fix Next (High Impact)**

- **Frequently used documents** — Annual reports, guides, forms that get regular downloads.
- **Video content** — Add captions to videos, starting with the most viewed.
- **Third-party tools** — Audit embedded tools and widgets; request VPATs and remediation timelines.

**Tier 3: Fix Systematically (Ongoing)**

- **Archive content** — Older documents and pages with lower traffic.
- **Social media backlog** — Historical posts (new posts should be accessible from now on).
- **Comprehensive remediation** — Work through remaining issues methodically.

**Practical steps to get started:**

1. **Audit your content inventory** — Know what you have (pages, documents, videos, tools)
2. **Identify your top 20** — Focus on the 20 highest-priority items first
3. **Stop the bleeding** — Require accessibility for all new content immediately
4. **Track progress** — Document what you've fixed and what remains
5. **Allocate time weekly** — Even 2-4 hours/week of focused remediation adds up

**Example prioritization (real agency scenario):**

A state agency with limited resources might prioritize like this:

- **Week 1-2:** Homepage and main navigation (highest traffic).
- **Week 3-4:** Online application forms (critical services).
- **Month 2:** Top 10 most-downloaded PDFs (frequently used documents).
- **Month 3:** Video captions for training materials (high-impact multimedia).
- **Ongoing:** All new content created accessibly, archive content as time permits.

**What agencies like yours actually do:**

- Assign accessibility responsibilities to specific staff
- Include accessibility in project timelines and content workflows
- Use automated testing (WAVE, axe) for quick wins
- Request vendor accessibility documentation before purchasing
- Celebrate progress — fixing 50% is better than fixing 0%

**Key takeaway:** You don't have to fix everything at once, but you do have to start. Prioritize by impact, document your plan, and make steady progress. The goal is to remove as many barriers as possible for as many people as possible by the deadline.

### What's the bare minimum we need to do by April 2026?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** There's no official "minimum" — the law requires full WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. But if you're overwhelmed, here’s a pragmatic way to triage: make new content accessible going forward, focus on the highest-impact barriers first, and document a clear plan for the rest.

**Full explanation:**

**Legally, there is no "minimum."** The requirement is full compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA for all public-facing digital content. However, we understand that 100% compliance by the deadline may not be realistic for everyone.

**Here's what "minimum viable compliance" looks like in practice:**

**1. Start by preventing new barriers (effective immediately):**

- All new documents use heading styles and alt text
- All new videos have captions
- All new web content is keyboard-accessible
- All new purchases include WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements in contracts

**2. Focus on the biggest barriers first:**

- Homepage and main navigation
- Forms and applications (anything people need to access services)
- Top 20 most-visited pages
- Top 20 most-downloaded documents
- Any content that completely blocks access (e.g., missing form labels, no keyboard navigation)

**3. Document your remediation plan:**

- Inventory of what exists
- Prioritized list of what needs fixing
- Timeline with milestones
- Who's responsible for what
- Process for responding to accessibility complaints

**4. Respond to requests and reports:**

- Have a process to provide accessible alternatives upon request
- Post contact information for accessibility issues
- Track and respond to complaints promptly

**What you cannot skip:**

- New content should be created accessibly going forward
- High-impact public services must be accessible
- You must provide accessible alternatives when someone asks

**What can wait (if you have to triage):**

- Archived content not currently used
- Low-traffic pages with minimal public impact
- Historical social media posts

**Example "bare minimum" approach (realistic scenario):**

A small state agency with 5 staff and 200+ documents might:

- **Immediately:** Make sure all new content is created accessibly (so the backlog doesn’t grow).
- **Month 1:** Fix homepage, main navigation, and top 3 application forms.
- **Month 2-3:** Remediate top 10 most-downloaded PDFs.
- **Month 4-6:** Add captions to all training videos.
- **Ongoing:** Document remaining issues, provide accessible alternatives upon request, continue remediation.

**The bottom line:** The legal requirement is full WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance. In practice, clear prioritization plus documented, steady progress is far more defensible (and more helpful to residents) than trying to do everything at once or getting stuck. Start with the biggest barriers, prevent new ones, and keep improving.

## Compliance Requirements (IITAA and ADA Title II)

### What is the IITAA?

**The IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** requires Illinois agencies and universities to ensure that their websites, information systems, and information technologies are accessible to people with disabilities. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 24, 2024) require conformance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official IITAA page:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html</a>

### Who must comply with the IITAA?

The IITAA applies to:

- Executive, legislative, and judicial branches of Illinois state government
- All state departments, divisions, and agencies
- Constitutional offices
- Public universities

The IITAA does **not** directly apply to:

- Local governments
- School districts
- Community colleges
- Private organizations

**Note:** Local governments and school districts still have obligations under ADA Title II.

### What does the IITAA cover?

The IITAA covers all "information and communication technology," including:

- Websites and web applications
- Software and desktop applications
- Mobile applications
- Electronic documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Multimedia (video and audio)
- Information kiosks
- Hardware with user interfaces

### When did the current IITAA standards take effect?

- **IITAA 1.0** — August 20, 2008 (original standards).
- **IITAA 2.0** — January 18, 2018 (aligned with WCAG 2.0 AA).
- **IITAA 2.1** — June 24, 2024 (aligned with WCAG 2.1 Level AA).

### Where can I get IITAA training?

The Illinois Department of Innovation & Technology (DoIT) Office of Information Accessibility provides free training for state agencies, including:

- Introduction to Accessibility (2-hour overview)
- Accessible Word Documents (half-day hands-on lab)
- Accessible PDF Documents
- Accessible PowerPoint Presentations
- Customized courses on web development, forms, and more

**Request training:** DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov

- Springfield: 217-524-3648
- Chicago: 312-814-3648
- TTY: 866-277-5669

### What is the ADA Title II web accessibility rule?

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule establishing specific technical requirements for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rule requires state and local governments to make their public-facing digital content meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official fact sheet:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>

### How does Title II differ from Title I? I'm familiar with Title I, but Title II is new to me.

**Quick answer:** **Title I** covers **employment** and reasonable accommodations for employees. **Title II** covers **public services** and requires state and local governments to proactively make public-facing digital content meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** by the compliance deadline.

**The key difference:** Title I is about **individual workplace accommodations**. Title II is about **equitable public access** to government services — including digital services — using a **measurable standard** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).

**Title I (Employment):**

- Focus: employees and job applicants
- Approach: reasonable accommodations, case-by-case (interactive process)
- “Standard”: no single technical web standard required — it’s about reasonable access in context

**Examples:** accessible internal documents when needed; assistive tech software; modified equipment.

**Title II (Public Services):**

- Focus: programs/services offered to the public
- Approach: proactive accessibility for everyone (not just when requested)
- Standard: **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** for public-facing web content and mobile apps (per the 2024 web rule)

**Examples:** accessible websites/forms; accessible PDFs; captions for videos; accessible third‑party tools used to deliver services.

**Key differences (at a glance):**

| Aspect                  | Title I (Employment)                                          | Title II (Public Services)                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Who it applies to**   | Employers (private and public)                                | State and local governments                    |
| **What it covers**      | Employment practices and workplace accommodations             | Public programs, services, and activities      |
| **Approach**            | Case-by-case reasonable accommodations                        | Proactive accessibility for all public content |
| **Technical standards** | No specific standards; accommodations determined individually | WCAG 2.1 Level AA required                     |
| **Timeline**            | Accommodations provided when requested                        | Must be compliant by April 2026 deadline       |
| **Scope**               | Individual employee needs                                     | All public-facing digital content              |
| **Internal vs. public** | Primarily internal (workplace)                                | Primarily public-facing content                |

**Why it can feel “new”:** The **web rule is recent (April 2024)** — it’s the first time DOJ set a specific digital standard under Title II.

**For Illinois state agencies:** You must do both — **Title I** for employees and **Title II** for the public.

**Key takeaway:** Title I is about employment accommodations (what you're familiar with), while Title II is about making public services accessible to everyone (what the 2026 deadline addresses). The April 2024 web rule is the first time Title II has had specific technical standards for digital content, which is why it may feel new even though Title II itself has existed since 1990.

### When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?

| Entity Size                                    | Compliance Deadline |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Entities serving populations of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Entities serving populations under 50,000      | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026** (since Illinois has over 12 million residents).

### Does ADA Title II apply to internal documents?

**No, the ADA Title II web rule does not directly apply to purely internal content.** The rule specifically covers "services, programs, and activities provided or made available" to the public.

**However**, internal content may still need to be accessible under:

- **ADA Title I** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which could include making internal systems accessible.
- **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities.
- **IITAA** — Illinois law covers intranets and internal systems used by state employees.

**Best practice:** Make internal documents accessible proactively. It's easier than retrofitting later, and you may have employees with disabilities who need access.

### Are there any exceptions to the ADA Title II rule?

Yes, limited exceptions exist for:

1. **Archived content** — Content created before the compliance date that is not currently used for services
2. **Pre-existing conventional electronic documents** — Documents created before the compliance date, **unless** currently used by the public to participate in or benefit from the entity's services, programs, or activities
3. **Third-party content** — Content posted by third parties not under contract
4. **Password-protected individual documents** — Documents specific to one person's account
5. **Pre-existing social media posts** — Posts made before the compliance deadline

**Important:** Even when exceptions apply, you may still need to provide accessible alternatives upon request.

## Liability and Individual Responsibilities

### After the April 2026 deadline passes, who is liable for inaccessible content?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** Under ADA Title II, **the government entity (the state agency) is legally liable** — not individual employees. The U.S. Department of Justice files complaints against the organization, not individual staff members. However, all employees have professional responsibilities to ensure accessible content within their roles. Understanding your specific responsibilities helps protect both your agency and yourself professionally.

**How ADA Title II enforcement works:**

**The agency is the legal target:**

- **ADA Title II applies to public entities** — The law holds state and local government agencies responsible for compliance, not individual employees.
- **DOJ complaints target the organization** — When the Department of Justice investigates accessibility complaints, they file against the agency (e.g., "Department of Justice v. Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority"), not against individual employees.
- **The agency faces consequences** — Penalties, consent decrees, and remediation requirements fall on the organization.

**Individual employees are generally protected:**

- **No personal financial liability** — Individual state employees are not personally fined or sued under ADA Title II enforcement actions.
- **Performance expectations** — However, accessibility is part of your job duties. Repeated failure to follow agency accessibility policies could be addressed through standard employment processes (performance reviews, training requirements, etc.).
- **Professional responsibility** — While you won't be named in a DOJ complaint, you have a professional obligation to create accessible content within your role.

### What is my liability as a manager?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** You are not personally liable under ADA Title II (the agency is), but you have professional responsibility to ensure your team follows accessibility requirements. Your key responsibilities: allocate resources for accessibility work, ensure staff receive training, hold staff accountable for accessible deliverables, and escalate barriers that your team cannot resolve.

**Your professional responsibilities as a manager:**

**1. Resource allocation:**
- **Budget for accessibility** — Ensure your team has time and resources to create accessible content.
- **Prioritize accessibility in project planning** — Treat accessibility as a core requirement, not just a “nice to have.”
- **Set realistic timelines** — Timelines that force teams to skip accessibility checks increase risk for the agency.

**2. Staff training and support:**
- **Ensure staff receive accessibility training** — Don't assume staff "already know" accessibility requirements.
- **Provide access to tools** — Screen readers, testing tools, accessible templates.
- **Support staff when they identify barriers** — If a vendor tool isn't accessible, work with procurement to address it.

**3. Accountability for deliverables:**
- **Include accessibility in performance expectations** — Make it clear that accessibility is an expected part of deliverables.
- **Review deliverables for accessibility** — Use checklists/testing so issues are caught before approval.
- **Document accessibility issues** — If staff repeatedly produce inaccessible content despite training, address it through normal performance management.

**4. Escalation and problem-solving:**
- **Escalate systemic barriers** — If your team lacks training, tools, or vendor cooperation, escalate to leadership.
- **Work with your agency's accessibility coordinator** — They can provide guidance and help remove barriers.
- **Respond to accessibility complaints** — If someone reports an accessibility barrier, treat it seriously and route it to the right team.

**What protects you professionally:**

- **Document your efforts** — Keep records of accessibility training provided, tools purchased, policies implemented.
- **Follow agency accessibility policies** — If your agency has adopted accessibility standards, ensure your team follows them.
- **Seek guidance when unsure** — Contact your agency's accessibility coordinator or Illinois DoIT for help.

**Key takeaway:** You won't be named in a DOJ lawsuit, but accessibility is part of your management responsibilities. Not addressing accessibility increases legal risk for the agency.

### What is my liability as a web developer?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** You are not personally liable under ADA Title II (the agency is), but you have professional responsibility to build accessible websites and applications. Your key responsibilities: implement WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards in all development work, test for accessibility before deploying, document known accessibility barriers, and escalate issues you cannot resolve (e.g., inaccessible vendor components).

**Your professional responsibilities as a web developer:**

**1. Build accessibility into your work:**
- **Follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards** — This is the compliance standard required by ADA Title II and IITAA.
- **Use semantic HTML** — Proper heading structure, form labels, alt text for images.
- **Ensure keyboard accessibility** — All interactive elements must work without a mouse.
- **Test with assistive technology** — Use screen readers, keyboard navigation, zoom testing.

**2. Test before deployment:**
- **Run automated tests** — Use tools like axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse.
- **Perform manual testing** — Automated tools catch ~30-40% of accessibility issues; manual testing is essential.
- **Don't deploy content you know is inaccessible** — If you've identified accessibility barriers, fix them before launch.

**3. Document and communicate:**
- **Document known accessibility issues** — If you inherit inaccessible code or use vendor components with barriers, document them.
- **Communicate barriers to management** — If a vendor tool or framework has accessibility issues, escalate it.
- **Provide accessibility guidance to content creators** — Help non-technical staff understand what they need to do.

**4. Stay current with standards:**
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA is the current standard** — Familiarize yourself with all Level A and Level AA success criteria.
- **Monitor Illinois DoIT guidance** — <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT Accessibility Office</a>.
- **Seek training when needed** — Accessibility is complex; ongoing learning is part of the job.

**What protects you professionally:**

- **Follow established standards** — WCAG 2.1 Level AA is the objective standard; if you meet it, you're doing your job.
- **Document your testing** — Keep records of accessibility tests performed and issues addressed.
- **Escalate unsolvable problems** — If a vendor component is inaccessible and you can't fix it, document it and escalate to management.

**Common misconceptions:**

- **"I'm just following the design"** — If a design includes inaccessible patterns, it's your professional responsibility to flag it.
- **"The CMS made me do it"** — You're responsible for ensuring the output is accessible, even if you're working within a CMS or framework.
- **"We'll fix it later"** — Accessibility must be built in from the start; retrofitting is expensive and often incomplete.

**Key takeaway:** You won't be named in a DOJ lawsuit, but accessibility is a core part of web development. Building accessible experiences and documenting known constraints helps protect the agency and users.

### What is my liability as a content creator?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** You are not personally liable under ADA Title II (the agency is), but you have professional responsibility to create accessible content. Your key responsibilities: use accessible document templates, add alt text to images, structure documents with headings, ensure sufficient color contrast, and test documents before publishing.

**Your professional responsibilities as a content creator:**

**1. Use accessible templates and formatting:**
- **Start with accessible templates** — Don't create documents from scratch; use pre-built accessible templates.
- **Use built-in heading styles** — Don't fake headings with bold text; use Word/InDesign heading styles.
- **Use built-in list formatting** — Don't create fake lists with dashes or bullets; use the list tools.
- **Add table headers** — If you create tables, mark the header row properly.

**2. Provide alternative text for images:**
- **Every meaningful image needs alt text** — Describe what the image conveys, not just what it shows.
- **Decorative images can be marked as decorative** — If an image is purely decorative, mark it as such.
- **Complex images need longer descriptions** — Charts, graphs, and infographics may need extended descriptions.

**3. Ensure readability and usability:**
- **Check color contrast** — Text must have sufficient contrast against its background (use a <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contrast checker</a>).
- **Don't rely on color alone** — Use text labels, patterns, or icons in addition to color.
- **Use plain language** — Clear, simple language benefits everyone, especially people with cognitive disabilities.
- **Provide descriptive link text** — Avoid "click here"; use "Download the 2024 annual report".

**4. Test before publishing:**
- **Run the built-in accessibility checker** — Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, and other tools have accessibility checkers.
- **Test with a screen reader** — Listen to how your content sounds when read aloud.
- **Ensure logical reading order** — Does the content make sense when read top to bottom?

**What protects you professionally:**

- **Follow agency accessibility policies** — If your agency provides training and templates, use them.
- **Ask for help when unsure** — Contact your web developer, accessibility coordinator, or DoIT for guidance.
- **Document accessibility efforts** — Keep track of training completed and templates used.

**Common misconceptions:**

- **"Someone else will fix it"** — Accessibility must be built in from the start; it's not something that can be easily fixed later.
- **"I don't have time"** — Accessibility takes practice, but it becomes second nature. Most tasks (adding alt text, using heading styles) add minimal time.
- **"My content isn't public-facing"** — Internal documents must also be accessible under IITAA and Section 504.

**Key takeaway:** You won't be named in a DOJ lawsuit, but creating accessible content is part of your job duties. Consistently applying training and using checklists reduces risk and helps residents access services.

### What is my liability as someone on executive staff?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** You are not personally liable under ADA Title II (the agency is), but you have strategic and oversight responsibilities. Your key responsibilities: ensure the agency has an accessibility policy, allocate budget and resources for accessibility work, designate an accessibility coordinator, ensure staff receive training, and monitor compliance agency-wide.

**Your strategic and oversight responsibilities:**

**1. Policy and leadership:**
- **Adopt an agency accessibility policy** — Make accessibility an official priority with clear expectations.
- **Designate an accessibility coordinator** — Someone needs to own accessibility strategy and compliance tracking.
- **Communicate the importance of accessibility** — Staff take accessibility seriously when leadership does.

**2. Resource allocation:**
- **Budget for accessibility** — Training, tools, testing, remediation, and potentially staff time.
- **Allocate staff time for accessibility work** — Don't expect staff to "fit it in" around other priorities.
- **Invest in accessible tools and platforms** — Cheaper tools that produce inaccessible output cost more in the long run.

**3. Training and capacity building:**
- **Ensure all staff receive accessibility training** — Content creators, web developers, managers, procurement staff.
- **Provide ongoing learning opportunities** — Accessibility standards evolve; one-time training isn't enough.
- **Support staff when they need specialized expertise** — Sometimes you need consultants or expert review.

**4. Compliance monitoring and accountability:**
- **Track accessibility compliance** — Regular audits, testing, and issue tracking.
- **Address barriers systematically** — Don't just fix individual complaints; identify and fix systemic issues.
- **Hold managers accountable** — Accessibility should be part of management performance expectations.
- **Report to Illinois DoIT as required** — State agencies must comply with IITAA reporting requirements.

**5. Risk management:**
- **Understand your agency's accessibility exposure** — How much public-facing content do you have? How accessible is it?
- **Prioritize high-risk content** — Core services and frequently accessed content should be addressed first.
- **Address complaints promptly** — When someone reports an accessibility barrier, treat it seriously.
- **Consult legal counsel when needed** — If you receive a formal complaint or DOJ inquiry, involve legal immediately.

**What protects your agency (and you professionally):**

- **Demonstrate good faith effort** — Document your accessibility efforts, even if you're not 100% compliant yet.
- **Follow Illinois DoIT guidance** — The state accessibility office provides resources and support.
- **Respond to complaints promptly** — DOJ looks favorably on organizations that address barriers quickly.
- **Don’t rely on awareness gaps** — After April 2026, it’s reasonable to expect increased scrutiny and clearer expectations.

**The bottom line:** You won't be named personally in a DOJ lawsuit, but as an executive, you own the agency's accessibility strategy. Not addressing accessibility increases legal and reputational risk for the agency — and the rule sets a clear, enforceable standard and timeline.

### How can I protect myself professionally while ensuring my agency stays compliant?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** Follow established accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA), document your efforts, seek training and guidance when needed, and escalate systemic barriers you cannot resolve. The key is demonstrating good faith effort to create accessible content within your role.

**Practical steps for all roles:**

**1. Get trained:**
- **Take accessibility training** — Many free resources are available; see [Where can I learn more about accessibility?](#getting-help-where-can-i-learn-more-about-accessibility).
- **Learn the basics for your role** — You don't need to be an expert in everything, but you need to know your responsibilities.
- **Stay current** — Standards evolve; check Illinois DoIT guidance periodically.

**2. Use the right tools:**
- **Use accessibility checkers** — Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, browser extensions like WAVE or axe.
- **Use accessible templates** — Don't create documents from scratch.
- **Test your work** — Keyboard navigation, screen reader testing, color contrast checks.

**3. Document your efforts:**
- **Keep records of training completed** — Certificates, course completion, workshops attended.
- **Document testing performed** — Accessibility reports, test results, issues identified and fixed.
- **Track time spent on accessibility** — If accessibility work is taking significant time, document it.

**4. Communicate and escalate:**
- **Ask questions when unsure** — Contact your accessibility coordinator, web developer, or Illinois DoIT.
- **Flag accessibility barriers** — If a tool, vendor, or process creates barriers, report it.
- **Raise concerns early** — If you’re being pressured to skip accessibility steps, bring it to your manager or accessibility coordinator so priorities and timelines can be adjusted.

**5. Follow agency policies:**
- **If your agency has accessibility policies, follow them** — Policies exist to protect both the agency and you.
- **Participate in accessibility initiatives** — Audits, remediation efforts, policy development.
- **Take complaints seriously** — If someone reports an accessibility issue with your content, address it promptly.

**What doesn't protect you:**

- **"Nobody told me"** — After April 2026, it’s reasonable to expect organizations to have informed and trained staff. Seek training if you haven’t received it.
- **"I didn't have time"** — Accessibility is an enforceable requirement. If you’re being given impossible deadlines, escalate early so scope/timelines can be adjusted.
- **"The vendor made me do it"** — You're responsible for the output, even if you're using third-party tools.
- **"I thought someone else would fix it"** — Accessibility must be built in from the start.

**The bottom line for everyone:**

- **You won't be personally sued** — ADA Title II targets the agency, not individual employees.
- **And accessibility is part of your job** — It’s a professional responsibility tied to public service delivery.
- **Document good faith effort** — Show that you're trying to meet accessibility standards.
- **Seek help when needed** — You don't have to know everything, but you need to know when to ask for help.

## Website Accessibility

### How do I test my website for accessibility?

**Why this matters:** Automated tools catch many issues quickly, but they can't detect everything. Manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers reveals barriers that automated tools miss — and these barriers can prevent people with disabilities from using your website entirely.

Use a combination of automated and manual testing:

**Automated Testing Tools (free):**

- **WAVE** — <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wave.webaim.org/</a> (browser extension)
- **axe DevTools** — <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.deque.com/axe/</a> (browser extension)
- **ANDI** — <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html</a> (bookmarklet)
- **Lighthouse** — Built into Chrome DevTools.

**Manual Testing:**

- Keyboard navigation — Can you access everything without a mouse?
- Screen reader testing — Does content make sense when read aloud?
- Zoom and reflow testing — Does content remain usable at 200% zoom? At 400% zoom (or 320px viewport width), does content reflow without requiring horizontal scrolling?
- Color contrast — Is text readable against its background?

**Illinois testing guidance:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html</a>

### Do we need an independent (external) accessibility audit to prove compliance? When is it worth it?

{new:2026-01-02}

**Quick answer:** An external audit is **not the only way** to validate accessibility, but it can be worth it for **high-risk, high-visibility services** or when you need **independent evidence**. Regardless of who does it, **no automated tool alone can determine conformance** — knowledgeable human evaluation is required.

**When it’s worth paying for an external audit:**

- **High-risk public services** (forms, applications, services that affect benefits, rights, public access)
- **Large public sites** where sampling + methodology matters
- **Vendor-delivered systems** where you need third-party documentation and leverage for remediation
- **When leadership doesn’t trust internal validation** and you need an independent report

**When internal evaluation can be sufficient (if done well):**

- You have staff with accessibility testing skills (web + documents)
- You follow a recognized methodology and produce a clear report
- You maintain evidence of testing and remediation over time

### Can’t we just use an accessibility overlay/widget (a “one-click fix”) instead of doing remediation?

{new:2026-01-02}

**Quick answer:** No. Overlays/widgets can add UI features, but they **do not reliably make a site conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA** because accessibility issues usually require **fixing the underlying code and content**. Also, **conformance cannot be validated by automation alone**.

**Why overlays don’t solve compliance:**

- **WCAG issues are often structural** (labels, headings, keyboard behavior, focus order, meaningful text alternatives, error handling). These require real fixes in templates, components, and content—not a layer on top.
- **Automation limits still apply.** If a tool can’t determine conformance on its own, an overlay (which is largely automation) can’t guarantee compliance either.
- **Accessibility practitioners consistently rate overlays as ineffective** compared to doing real remediation.

**What to do instead (the practical manager approach):**

1. **Stop creating new barriers** (publish/purchase/build with accessibility checks).
2. **Prioritize** high-traffic and high-stakes services first.
3. **Use tools + human testing** to find issues, then remediate and re-test.

1. **Missing or inadequate alt text** for images
2. **Poor color contrast** between text and background
3. **Missing form labels** — form fields without associated labels
4. **Keyboard inaccessibility** — interactive elements that can't be reached or operated with a keyboard
5. **Missing or improper heading structure** — headings used for styling rather than structure
6. **Missing captions or transcripts** for video/audio content
7. **Links that don't make sense out of context** — "click here" or "read more"
8. **Missing page titles** or duplicate titles across pages
9. **Tables without proper headers** — data tables lacking row/column headers
10. **Auto-playing media** without controls

### What color contrast ratio is required?

For WCAG 2.1 Level AA:

- **Normal text** (smaller than 18pt/~24px regular or 14pt/~19px bold): **4.5:1** contrast ratio.
- **Large text** (18pt/~24px+ regular or 14pt/~19px+ bold): **3:1** contrast ratio.
- **UI components and graphics**: **3:1** contrast ratio (for interactive elements, icons, and graphical objects required to understand content - WCAG SC 1.4.11).

### Do I need to caption all videos?

Yes, for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance:

- **Pre-recorded video with audio** — Requires synchronized captions.
- **Live video with audio** — Requires live captions (accuracy matters; auto-captions may need human support).
- **Pre-recorded audio only** — Requires a text transcript.
- **Video with essential visual content** — Requires audio description at Level AA **only if** important visual information isn't already conveyed in the existing audio track. For example, a video where a speaker says 'as you can see on this chart...' without describing the chart would need audio description. A talking-head video where the speaker fully explains their points verbally typically does not.

### How do I make mobile apps accessible?

**Quick answer:** Mobile apps must meet the same WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as websites. This includes proper labeling, keyboard/gesture navigation, sufficient color contrast, and compatibility with mobile screen readers (VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android).

**Full explanation:**

Mobile apps provided to the public by state and local governments must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards under the ADA Title II web rule. Mobile accessibility follows the same principles as web accessibility, but with platform-specific considerations.

**Core mobile accessibility requirements:**

1. **Screen reader compatibility** — Apps must work with:
   - **iOS:** VoiceOver (built-in)
   - **Android:** TalkBack (built-in)
   - Content must be properly labeled and navigable

2. **Touch target size** — While WCAG 2.1 Level AA doesn't mandate specific sizes, platform guidelines recommend at least 44x44 points (iOS) or 48x48 density-independent pixels (Android) for usability. This is considered essential best practice for users with motor disabilities.

3. **Color contrast** — Same 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text as web content

4. **Alternative input methods** — Support for:
   - External keyboards
   - Switch control devices
   - Voice control

5. **Dynamic content** — Announce updates to screen readers (e.g., form validation, loading states)

**Platform-specific guidance:**

**iOS (Apple):**

- Use native accessibility APIs (UIAccessibility)
- Test with VoiceOver (Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver)
- Use semantic labels (`accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`)
- Support Dynamic Type for text scaling
- Ensure proper focus management

**Android:**

- Use Android Accessibility APIs
- Test with TalkBack (Settings > Accessibility > TalkBack)
- Use content descriptions for images and icons
- Support font scaling
- Implement proper focus indicators

**Step-by-step mobile app accessibility workflow:**

1. **Design phase:**
   - Aim for touch targets of at least 44x44 points (strong usability best practice)
   - Design with sufficient color contrast
   - Plan for text scaling (support Dynamic Type/Large Text)
   - Avoid relying solely on color to convey information

2. **Development phase:**
   - Use native accessibility APIs (don't build custom solutions)
   - Add accessibility labels to all interactive elements
   - Test with screen readers during development (not just at the end)
   - Implement proper focus management

3. **Testing phase:**
   - Test with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android)
   - Test with keyboard navigation (external keyboard)
   - Test with text scaling enabled
   - Test with color contrast checkers
   - Use automated tools (axe DevTools Mobile, Accessibility Scanner for Android)

4. **Before release:**
   - Complete accessibility audit
   - Document known issues and remediation plan
   - Test with real users with disabilities if possible

**Common mobile accessibility mistakes:**

- **Too-small touch targets** — Buttons or links that are hard to tap.
- **Missing labels** — Icons without text descriptions.
- **Poor focus management** — Focus gets lost or trapped.
- **Inaccessible gestures** — Complex swipe patterns that can't be performed with assistive technology.
- **No keyboard support** — App doesn't work with external keyboards.

### What about third-party widgets, embedded content, dashboards, and maps?

**Yes.** You are responsible for the accessibility of third-party content that you embed or integrate into your website through contracts or agreements. This includes:

- Payment processors, scheduling tools, chat widgets
- Embedded maps (like ArcGIS) and dashboards (like Tableau)
- Social media feeds, survey tools
- Learning management systems (LMS), document signing tools (like DocuSign), and other third-party services

**Minimum requirements (what "accessible" means):**

- Works **with keyboard only** (no mouse required)
- Works with a **screen reader** (labels, controls, and structure make sense)
- Meets **contrast** requirements and has visible focus

**What to do:**

1. **Request accessibility documentation** (VPAT/ACR) from vendors before purchasing
2. **Include accessibility requirements in contracts** (require WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
3. **Test the workflow** using keyboard navigation, screen reader, and automated checkers (see: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#website-accessibility-how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do-i-do-to-verify-for-example-docebo-or-docusign-compliance))
4. **Provide an accessible alternative** if the tool can't be made accessible:
   - **Dashboards/maps:** accessible data tables/CSV downloads + plain-language summaries
   - **Maps:** accessible lists/tables of locations + text explanation of what the map shows
   - **Other tools:** equivalent accessible methods to complete the same service

**For specific tools:** See questions below about [DocuSign](#website-accessibility-how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do-i-do-to-verify-for-example-docebo-or-docusign-compliance), [LMS systems](#website-accessibility-is-a-learning-management-system-lms-like-docebo-wc), and [existing content like Tableau or ArcGIS](#website-accessibility-if-we-have-existing-content-like-tableau-dashboard).

**Reference:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a> (see section on "Third-Party Content Provided Through Contracts or Agreements")

### Does our agency's password-protected intranet need to be accessible?

**Quick answer:** Password-protected intranet sites for employees only are generally exempt from ADA Title II, but **may still need to be accessible under Illinois state law (IITAA), ADA Title I (employment), and Section 504** (federal funding). Always prioritize employee accommodations if requested.

**Full explanation:**

**It depends.** Password-protected intranet sites that are **only accessible to agency employees** (not the public) are generally **exempt from the ADA Title II web rule**, but they may still need to be accessible under other laws.

**ADA Title II exemption:**

The ADA Title II web rule specifically covers content "provided or made available to the public." Password-protected intranet sites that are:

- Only accessible to agency employees
- Not accessible to the general public
- Protected by authentication (login required)

...are generally **exempt from ADA Title II WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements**.

**However, other compliance requirements may still apply:**

1. **IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** — Illinois state law requires that intranets and internal systems used by state employees be accessible
2. **ADA Title I (Employment)** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. If an employee needs to access the intranet to do their job, it may need to be accessible
3. **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities

**Best practice:** Make your intranet accessible proactively. It supports employees with disabilities, prevents costly retrofitting, and ensures compliance with IITAA.

**Resources:**

- **IITAA Requirements:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html</a>
- **ADA Title I (Employment):** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/</a>

### What about archived documents on the intranet?

**Quick answer:** Truly archived documents that are no longer used may be exempt, but you must still provide accessible alternatives **upon request** if an employee needs them.

**Full explanation:**

**Archived documents that are not currently used may be exempt** — but you must still provide accessible alternatives **upon request**.

**For truly archived documents:**

- Historical records not currently referenced
- Old versions replaced by newer documents
- Content no longer needed for business operations

**Exception:** Even archived documents should be made accessible if they're:

- Referenced or linked from active intranet pages
- Part of a searchable document library
- Needed for reference or historical context

**If an employee requests access to archived content, you must provide an accessible version.**

### After April 2026, do all new documents need to be accessible?

**Quick answer:** Yes. All new documents created or published after April 24, 2026 must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards from day one — whether posted publicly or on an intranet.

**Full explanation:**

**Yes. All new documents created after the April 24, 2026 deadline must be accessible** — whether they're posted publicly or on an intranet.

**For new documents (created after April 24, 2026):**

- **Yes** — All new documents (PDFs, Excel, Word, PowerPoint) must be accessible.
- Make accessibility part of your document creation workflow
- This includes documents created internally or received from external sources

**For existing documents (created before April 24, 2026):**

- **Prioritize by usage** — Focus on:
  - Documents actively used by employees or the public
  - Frequently accessed documents
  - Documents required for services or job functions
  - Documents linked from main pages
- **Archived documents** — May remain as-is unless someone requests access, at which point you must provide an accessible version.

**Key principle:** The requirement is to ensure people with disabilities can access the information they need. If a document is truly archived and never accessed, it may not need immediate remediation. But if anyone needs it, you must provide an accessible version.

**Best practices:**

1. **Create an accessibility workflow** — Make all new documents accessible before posting
2. **Prioritize remediation** — Focus on frequently used existing documents
3. **Respond to requests** — Have a process to quickly provide accessible versions of archived documents upon request
4. **Document your efforts** — Keep records of what's accessible, what needs work, and any requests you've fulfilled

### How do I test third-party tool compliance? What do I do to verify (for example, Docebo or DocuSign) compliance?

**Why this matters:** Vendor claims about accessibility aren't always accurate, and even accessible platforms can become inaccessible through custom configuration or content you add. Testing real workflows ensures the tools your agency uses actually work for people with disabilities — not just in theory, but in practice.

**Quick answer:** Don't rely on vendor claims. Request a current VPAT, then test your **real workflows** with (1) keyboard-only navigation, (2) a screen reader, and (3) an automated checker (axe/WAVE). Document issues and require fixes (or an accessible alternative) before you go live.

**Minimum test plan (30–60 minutes):**

1. **Pick 2–3 real workflows** (example: “sign a document,” “enroll and complete a course,” “submit a form”).
2. **Run an automated scan** (axe DevTools or WAVE) on each workflow screen:
   - **axe DevTools** — <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.deque.com/axe/</a>
   - **WAVE** — <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wave.webaim.org/</a>
3. **Keyboard-only check** (no mouse):
   - You can reach everything (Tab/Shift+Tab) and activate it (Enter/Space)
   - Focus is visible and never gets “stuck”
4. **Screen reader spot-check** (at least one):
   - **NVDA** (free) — <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nvaccess.org/</a>
   - **VoiceOver** (built-in on Mac/iOS)
   - Confirm labels make sense, errors are announced, and the workflow can be completed
5. **Document what you found**:
   - Date/version tested, workflow steps, issues, and screenshots
   - “Workaround/alternative provided” if the vendor can’t fix quickly

**Procurement/contract expectations (what to ask for):**

- **VPAT/ACR** for the exact product/version you're buying/using.
- A list of **known issues** + vendor **remediation timeline**
- Contract language requiring **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** and support for accessibility fixes

**Ongoing monitoring (keep it lightweight):**

- Re-test after **major updates**, configuration/theme changes, or new integrations
- Track user feedback and escalate issues to the vendor

**Resources:**

- DoIT Testing Resources: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html</a>
- Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline: <a href="https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/</a>

**Key takeaway:** Test the workflows people actually use. If the tool can’t be made accessible quickly, you still need to provide an **accessible alternative** for the service.

### Our agency uses DocuSign to digitally sign documents. Is this something that falls under WCAG compliance?

**Quick answer:** Yes. If you use DocuSign for public-facing services, the **signing workflow** and the **documents you send** must be accessible.

**What to do (in order):**

1. **Make the documents accessible first** (Word/PDF before upload). DocuSign can’t “fix” an inaccessible document.
2. **Request DocuSign’s current VPAT/ACR** for your version and configuration.
3. **Test the real signing workflow** using the steps in: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#website-accessibility-how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do-i-do-to-verify-for-example-docebo-or-docusign-compliance)
4. **Have an accessible alternative** if a user can’t complete the signing process (example: an accessible PDF form + supported return method, in-person or assisted signing).

**Key takeaway:** Your agency is responsible for accessibility for services delivered through DocuSign. Start with accessible documents, verify the workflow, and keep a backup method ready.

### Is a Learning Management System (LMS) like Docebo WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant?

**Quick answer:** Sometimes partially. Even if the LMS platform is improving, **your course content and configuration still have to be accessible**.

**What can affect LMS accessibility:**

- Platform version/configuration
- Custom themes/branding
- Plugins/integrations
- Specific feature limitations (quizzes, embedded media, uploads, etc.)

**Accessible LMS course checklist (high impact):**

1. **Documents** — Upload accessible Word/PDF/PowerPoint files (make the source accessible first).
2. **Video/audio** — Captions for video; transcripts for audio; fix auto-captions.
3. **Images** — Alt text for images/graphics; don’t put essential text only in images.
4. **Structure** — Clear headings and descriptive link text; predictable navigation and module names.
5. **Interactivity** — Quizzes/forms are keyboard accessible, with clear labels and error messages.
6. **Color** — Sufficient contrast and no “color-only” meaning.
7. **Test the course** using: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#website-accessibility-how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do-i-do-to-verify-for-example-docebo-or-docusign-compliance)

**Resources:**

- WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference (Level AA): <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa</a>
- WebAIM Contrast Checker: <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>

**Key takeaway:** Treat the LMS like any other third-party tool: verify the platform, and ensure the content you upload is accessible.

### If we have existing content like Tableau dashboards, ArcGIS maps, or Docebo online courses, do those fall into the exemption category? Or do they need to be made immediately accessible?

**Quick answer:** If it's **currently used to provide public services**, it needs to be accessible (no "archived content" exemption). If it’s **truly archived and not used**, it may be exempt — but you still must provide an accessible alternative **upon request**.

**The key distinction:**

- **Currently used for services** = Must be accessible.
- **Archived/not currently used** = May be exempt, but must provide accessible alternatives upon request.

**What to do (works for dashboards, maps, and courses):**

1. **Inventory** what exists and label it **active** vs. **archived**
2. **Prioritize** by impact (high-traffic, high-stakes, frequently used)
3. **Make it accessible or provide an equivalent accessible alternative**, such as:
   - **Dashboards/maps:** accessible data tables/CSV downloads + plain-language summaries
   - **Courses:** accessible documents + captions/transcripts + accessible quiz interactions
4. **Test** using the workflow approach in: [How do I test third-party tool compliance?](#website-accessibility-how-do-i-test-third-party-tool-compliance-what-do-i-do-to-verify-for-example-docebo-or-docusign-compliance)
5. **Document** what you changed, what remains, and the alternatives you provide

**Tool-specific notes (common pain points):**

- **Tableau**: interactive charts often need **accessible tables** and clear descriptions. Don’t rely on hover-only tooltips.
- **ArcGIS**: complex interactive maps frequently need **equivalent text + data** (tables, lists of locations, and a written summary of what the map shows).
- **Docebo/LMS courses**: the platform may be “mostly accessible,” but **uploaded content and course design** are where failures usually occur (captions, docs, images, quizzes, navigation).

**Resources:**

- ADA Title II Web Rule: <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>
- DoIT Accessibility Guidance: <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html</a>

**Key takeaway:** If the public needs it to access a service, it must be accessible. If you can’t make the tool fully accessible quickly, provide an **equivalent accessible alternative** and document the remediation plan.

## Content Accessibility (Documents, PDFs, Presentations)

### My documents look fine — why do they need to be "accessible"?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** "Looking fine" means you can see the content visually. "Accessible" means people using screen readers, keyboard navigation, or other assistive technologies can also use the content — and that requires specific structure that's invisible to you but essential for them.

**Full explanation:**

When you create a document, you see formatted text, images, and layout. But someone using a screen reader experiences the document very differently — they hear it read aloud, navigate by headings, and rely on text descriptions of images. If those structural elements aren't there, the document is unusable for them.

**What "accessible" actually means (it's more than alt text):**

| What you see                               | What accessibility requires                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bold, large text that looks like a heading | Proper heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2) so screen readers can navigate |
| A nice-looking table                       | Header rows defined so screen readers announce column names                 |
| An image or chart                          | Alt text describing what's in the image                                     |
| A clickable link                           | Descriptive link text (not "click here")                                    |
| A form to fill out                         | Properly labeled form fields                                                |
| Good-looking colors                        | Sufficient contrast (4.5:1 ratio for text)                                  |

**Why this matters:**

- **Screen readers can't "see"** — they read the document's underlying structure, not its visual appearance.
- **Keyboard users can't click** — they navigate using Tab and arrow keys, which require proper structure.
- **Users with low vision may zoom 200%+** — the document must reflow properly.
- **Users with cognitive disabilities** — benefit from clear headings, simple language, and logical organization.

**The good news:** Making documents accessible usually makes them better organized and easier to use for everyone.

**Quick test:** Open your document and try navigating it using only the keyboard (Tab, arrow keys, Enter). If you can't reach everything or don't know where you are, it's not accessible.

### What about photos your agency takes at events — like speeches or awards ceremonies? Do those need to be accessible?

**Yes, if you're sharing them digitally.** Any photos published on your agency's website, social media, or in digital documents need alt text (alternative text) that describes the image for people who can't see it.

**What is alt text?**

Alt text is a brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who are blind or have low vision. It's also displayed if an image fails to load.

**How to write good alt text for event photos:**

- **Be specific and concise** — Describe what's actually happening in the photo.
- **Include relevant names** — If someone is being recognized, name them.
- **Describe the context** — What event is this? What's the setting?
- **Keep it brief** — Usually 1-2 sentences is sufficient.

**Examples:**

| Photo Type     | Poor Alt Text             | Good Alt Text                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Award ceremony | "Photo" or "IMG_4523.jpg" | "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe at the annual agency awards ceremony" |
| Speech         | "Person speaking"         | "Agency director addresses attendees at the 2025 victim services conference"                                      |
| Group photo    | "Group of people"         | "Agency research team staff at the December 2025 all-hands meeting"                                               |
| Event venue    | "Conference room"         | "Attendees networking during a break at the Illinois Criminal Justice Summit"                                     |

**Where to add alt text:**

- **Website/CMS** — Look for the "alt text" or "image description" field when uploading.
- **Word documents** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text.
- **PowerPoint** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text.
- **Social media** — Each platform has an alt text option (see Social Media Accessibility section).
- **Email** — Outlook and Gmail both support alt text for images.

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A</a> — All non-text content must have a text alternative

### How long should alt text be?

**Best practice: Keep alt text concise—aim for 1-2 sentences in most cases.** The commonly cited "125 character limit" isn't a technical requirement (modern screen readers handle longer text just fine), but brevity helps users process information quickly.

- **Ideal:** Concise and scannable (roughly 15-25 words).
- **Acceptable:** Longer alt text when the image requires detailed description.
- **Too short:** Single words like "photo" or "image" don't help anyone.
- **Consider alternatives:** If you need extensive description (charts, infographics, diagrams), use a visible caption, long description, or linked text instead of cramming everything into alt text.

**The key principle:** Alt text should be **concise but complete**. Describe what's meaningful about the image in as few words as necessary — but don't sacrifice clarity just to hit an arbitrary character limit.

**Key takeaway:** If you took the photo because it captures something meaningful, that meaning needs to be conveyed in alt text for people who can't see it. Keep it concise when possible, but don't truncate important information just to stay under 125 characters — modern screen readers can handle more.

### How do I handle complex images like charts, graphs, or infographics?

Some images — like charts, graphs, infographics, or images containing lots of text — need more than a brief alt text. Here's how to handle them:

**For charts and graphs with data:**

1. **Alt text:** Provide a brief summary of what the chart shows (e.g., "Bar chart showing Illinois crime rates declining 15% from 2020 to 2024")
2. **Data table:** Include the underlying data in an accessible table format, either directly below the chart or linked nearby
3. **Long description:** If the trends or patterns matter, describe them in the body text

**Example for a chart:**

- **Alt text:** "Line graph showing agency grant funding from 2020-2025. Full data in table below."
- **Below the image:** An accessible HTML table with the actual numbers.

**For infographics or images with lots of text:**

1. **Don't use images of text** — If possible, present the information as actual text on the page instead of as an image
2. **If you must use an image:** Provide the full text content in one of these ways:
   - A "long description" link that opens the full text
   - An expandable section below the image with the complete text
   - A text summary in the body of the page

**For scanned documents or PDF images:**

1. **Best approach:** Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the image to actual text
2. **If OCR isn't possible:** Provide a text transcript of the document content
3. **Alt text:** Describe what the document is (e.g., "Scanned letter from Governor dated June 2025. Full transcript below.")

**General rule for complex images:**

- **Alt text:** Brief summary + tell users where to find more detail.
- **Long description:** Provide full information in accessible text format nearby or linked.

**Example patterns:**

| Image Type       | Alt Text Approach                                     | Additional Requirement    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data chart       | "Chart showing [brief conclusion]. Data table below." | Accessible data table     |
| Infographic      | "Infographic about [topic]. Full text follows."       | Complete text version     |
| Scanned document | "[Document type] from [source]. Transcript provided." | Text transcript           |
| Complex diagram  | "Diagram of [subject]. Described in detail below."    | Detailed text description |

### How do I make images accessible on social media, Constant Contact, or Canva?

Sharing infographics, charts, or images with text on platforms like social media, Constant Contact, or Canva presents unique challenges because you often can't add data tables or long descriptions directly.

**Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn):**

- **Alt text limits vary** — Most platforms allow 100-1000 characters for alt text, but keep it concise.
- **Use the post text** — Put key information in the post caption itself, not just the image.
- **Link to more** — If sharing a complex infographic, link to a webpage with the full accessible version.
- **Don't rely on the image alone** — If the image contains important text or data, repeat it in your post.

**Example social media approach:**

- **Image:** Infographic showing "5 Steps to Accessible Documents"
- **Alt text:** "Infographic listing 5 steps to create accessible documents. Steps listed in post."
- **Post text:** "Here are 5 steps to accessible documents: 1) Use heading styles, 2) Add alt text to images, 3) Use meaningful link text, 4) Check color contrast, 5) Run accessibility checker. Full guide: [link]"

**Constant Contact and email marketing:**

- **Alt text field:** Constant Contact has an alt text field for images — use it.
- **Character limit:** Keep alt text brief since email clients vary in support.
- **Avoid image-only emails** — Don't put critical information only in images; many users have images disabled by default.
- **Provide text version** — Key messages should appear as actual text in the email, not just in graphics.

**Example email approach:**

- **Image:** Event announcement graphic with date, time, location
- **Alt text:** "Agency training event - details in text below"
- **Email body:** Include all event details as actual text below the image

**Canva:**

- **Canva supports alt text** — When you download or share, Canva can include alt text
- **Better approach:** Export important text content separately, not just as an image
- **For presentations:** Use Canva's presentation mode which supports alt text, or export to PowerPoint and add alt text there
- **For print vs. digital:** If creating something for digital distribution, consider whether it needs to be an image at all

**General rule for social/email:**

If you're sharing a complex image on social media or email, ask yourself: "If someone can't see this image, can they still get the information?" If not, you need to provide the content as text — either in the post/email body or linked to an accessible page.

### Who should write the alt text for photos?

**Ideally, the person supplying the photo should also supply the alt text.** They know what's happening in the image, who's pictured, and why it matters. If you're submitting photos for the website, a newsletter, or social media, include alt text with your submission.

- **You were there** — You know the context, the names, and what made the moment significant
- **You chose the photo** — You selected it for a reason; that reason should be in the alt text
- **It saves time** — The web team or communications staff shouldn't have to guess who's in the photo or what event it's from

**Best practice:** When submitting photos, include a simple list: "Photo 1: [alt text], Photo 2: [alt text]" etc.

### Are captions the same as alt text?

**No — captions and alt text serve different purposes and both may be needed.**

|                 | Caption                                              | Alt Text                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visibility**  | Visible to everyone on the page                      | Hidden; only read by screen readers or shown if image fails to load |
| **Purpose**     | Provides context, credits, or additional information | Describes the image for people who can't see it                     |
| **Who sees it** | All users                                            | Users with screen readers, or when images don't load                |
| **Required?**   | Optional but often helpful                           | Required for accessibility                                          |

**Example of both working together:**

- **Alt text:** "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe"
- **Caption:** "Officer John Doe receives the 2025 Excellence Award for his work on community violence intervention programs. Photo: Agency"

The alt text describes what's visually happening. The caption adds context that all readers benefit from (what the award was for, photo credit).

**When you might skip detailed alt text:**

- **Purely decorative images** — If a photo adds no meaningful information (like a decorative border), mark it as decorative. But event photos are almost never purely decorative.
- **Caption already describes it** — If there's a visible caption that fully describes the visual content, alt text can be briefer — but alt text is still required (even if just "Award ceremony as described in caption").

### Do all documents need to be accessible?

For public-facing documents, yes. Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, conventional electronic documents must be accessible, including:

**Accessibility best practice:** Before creating a document (especially a PDF), consider whether the content could be published as webpage text instead. HTML webpages are generally easier to make and keep accessible than PDFs. As <a href="https://it.cornell.edu/accessibility/create-accessible-pdfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cornell IT notes</a>, "Remediating PDFs for web accessibility can be more time consuming than creating a webpage. When possible, convert your PDFs to HTML web pages." The University of Illinois CITL PDF Accessibility Guide similarly notes that PDFs generally are not a very accessible format and recommends using PDFs only when no other alternative is available. This aligns with WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements and accessibility best practices. If you must use a document format, ensure it's accessible.

- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations

**Exceptions may apply for:**

- Pre-existing documents not currently used for services (still must provide accessible alternatives upon request)
- Password-protected documents specific to an individual's account

### How do I make a Word document accessible?

**See also:** [I'm a content creator. Where do I start?](#getting-started-i-m-a-content-creator-where-do-i-start) | [My documents look fine — why do they need to be "accessible"?](#content-accessibility-documents-pdfs-presentations-my-documents-look-fine-why-do-they-need-to-be-accessible) | [Do all documents need to be accessible?](#content-accessibility-documents-pdfs-presentations-do-all-documents-need-to-be-accessible)

**Step-by-step workflow for creating an accessible Word document:**

**Before you start:**

1. Use an accessible template if available (check with your agency's accessibility coordinator)
2. Plan your document structure (main heading, sections, subsections)

**During creation:**

1. **Set up document language** — File > Options > Language > Set as default
2. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
   - _Visual example:_ Instead of making text 18pt and bold, use the "Heading 1" style from the Styles pane
   - _Why:_ Screen readers use heading styles to navigate; bold text doesn't create navigation structure
3. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
   - _Visual example:_ For a photo of a meeting, alt text might be "Five people sitting around a conference table discussing a document"
   - _Why:_ Screen readers read alt text aloud; without it, images are invisible to users who can't see them
4. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
   - _Visual example:_ Use Table Tools > Design > Header Row checkbox to mark the first row as headers
   - _Why:_ Screen readers announce column headers when navigating table cells
5. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
   - _Visual example:_ "Download the 2025 Annual Report" instead of "Click here"
   - _Why:_ Screen readers can list all links on a page; "click here" provides no context
6. **Ensure sufficient color contrast** — Use the Accessibility Checker to identify contrast issues
7. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon (not manually typed dashes or numbers)
   - _Visual example:_ Use the bullet list button, not typing "-" before each item
   - _Why:_ Screen readers announce list structure and item count

**Before publishing:**

8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility
   - Fix all errors (red X)
   - Review warnings (yellow triangle)
   - Address tips (blue circle) when possible
9. **Test with a screen reader** — If available, use Narrator (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac) to verify the document makes sense when read aloud
10. **Save as accessible PDF** — If converting to PDF, use File > Save As > PDF, then check "Best for electronic distribution and accessibility"

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- Using text boxes for content (screen readers may skip them)
- Using watermarks that interfere with readability
- Embedding essential information only in headers/footers
- Using decorative fonts that are hard to read

Key steps for accessible Word documents:

1. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
2. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click > Edit Alt Text
3. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
4. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**
6. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon
7. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

**Best practice:** Consider publishing content as webpage text instead of PDF when feasible — it's generally easier to make and keep accessible. See: [Do all documents need to be accessible?](#content-accessibility-documents-pdfs-presentations-do-all-documents-need-to-be-accessible) for details. If you must use a PDF, follow the steps below.

The best approach depends on the source:

**If you have the source document (Word, InDesign, etc.):**

1. Make the source document accessible first
2. Export to PDF with accessibility settings enabled
3. Check and fix any remaining issues in Adobe Acrobat Pro

**If you only have the PDF:**

1. Run the Accessibility Checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro
2. Add tags using the Reading Order tool
3. Add alt text to images
4. Set the document language
5. Verify reading order
6. Test with a screen reader

### Is Canva accessible?

**Canva has made significant progress on accessibility** and offers several helpful features:

**What Canva does well:**

- **Design Accessibility checker** — Checks contrast, alt text, and typography
- **Automatic alt text suggestions** — AI-powered suggestions for image descriptions
- **Reading order and heading tagging** — Better structure for PDFs
- **Easier for non-designers** — More accessible than learning Adobe InDesign

**Important limitation:** Canva PDFs are not fully WCAG or PDF/UA compliant out of the box.

**Best practices for using Canva:**

1. **Use the Design Accessibility tool before exporting** — It will catch many issues
2. **Keep designs simple** — Simpler designs produce better accessibility results
3. **Test exported PDFs** — Use PAC 2024 or Adobe Acrobat to check accessibility
4. **Be prepared to remediate** — You may need to fix PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Pro after export
5. **Consider your audience** — For simple documents, Canva + remediation can work well. For complex technical documents, consider starting in Word or InDesign

**When Canva works well:**

- Social media graphics (with alt text added)
- Simple flyers and announcements
- Presentations with straightforward layouts
- Quick visual content that will be remediated afterward

**When to use alternatives:**

- Complex multi-page reports
- Documents with extensive tables or data
- Forms that need to be fillable and accessible
- Content requiring precise PDF/UA compliance

### How do I make emails and newsletters accessible?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** Emails follow the same principles as documents: use heading structure, add alt text to images, write descriptive links, and ensure good color contrast. The biggest difference is that many email clients have limited support for accessibility features, so simpler is better.

**Full explanation:**

Many state agencies send newsletters, announcements, and other email communications to the public. These emails need to be accessible too, especially if they contain important information about government services.

**Best practice for newsletters:** Consider publishing newsletter content as a webpage and linking to it from your email, rather than attaching a PDF. See: [Do all documents need to be accessible?](#content-accessibility-documents-pdfs-presentations-do-all-documents-need-to-be-accessible) for why HTML is generally easier to make accessible than PDFs.

**Email accessibility essentials:**

| Element           | What to do                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Images**        | Add alt text; assume images may not display (many email clients block images by default) |
| **Links**         | Use descriptive link text ("View the 2025 report" not "Click here")                      |
| **Structure**     | Use heading styles if your email platform supports them; keep layouts simple             |
| **Color**         | Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning; ensure sufficient contrast                  |
| **Plain text**    | Include a plain-text version of HTML emails when possible                                |
| **Critical info** | Put essential information in text, not just in images or graphics                        |

**Platform-specific tips:**

**Outlook (desktop and web):**

- Use the built-in Accessibility Checker (Review > Check Accessibility)
- Add alt text to images (right-click > Edit Alt Text)
- Use heading styles from the formatting toolbar
- Avoid excessive use of tables for layout

**Gmail:**

- Gmail has limited accessibility features for composing
- Keep formatting simple — bold, italics, lists
- Add image descriptions in the email body if alt text isn't available
- Include a plain-text alternative when possible

**Constant Contact / Mailchimp / Email marketing tools:**

- Use the alt text field for all images (it's usually available when you click on an image)
- Use built-in heading styles rather than just making text larger
- Test with keyboard navigation before sending
- Preview in multiple email clients
- Include an accessible web version link at the top

**Common email accessibility mistakes:**

1. **Image-only emails** — If the entire message is a graphic, users who can't see images (or have them blocked) get nothing
2. **"Click here" links** — Screen readers often read links out of context; "View the 2025 Annual Report" is much better
3. **Text in images** — Avoid putting text in images when possible; if you must, ensure sufficient contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
4. **Low contrast** — Light gray text on white backgrounds is hard to read for everyone
5. **Complex layouts** — Multi-column layouts often break in email clients and screen readers

**The key principle:** Assume someone might read your email:

- With images turned off
- Using a screen reader
- On a mobile device
- With low vision

If your message still makes sense in all those scenarios, you're doing it right.

## Social Media Accessibility

### Do social media posts need to be accessible? How do I make them accessible?

**Yes.** Under the ADA Title II rule, new social media posts by state and local governments must meet accessibility standards. Pre-existing posts (made before the compliance date) are generally exempt unless they're currently used to provide or facilitate access to services, programs, or activities.

**Note:** Social media platforms themselves have accessibility limitations, but you can control the content you post.

**How to make social media posts accessible:**

**For all platforms:**

- Write in plain language
- Use CamelCase for hashtags (#AccessibilityMatters)
- Limit emoji use; don't place multiple emojis together
- Put hashtags at the end of posts
- Keep videos captioned
- Use sufficient color contrast in graphics

**For images:**

- Add alt text (most platforms support this now)
- Don't put essential text only in images
- Describe images in the post if alt text isn't available
- **How to add alt text on different platforms:**
  - **X (Twitter):** When composing, click the image > "Add description"
  - **Facebook:** Click the image > Edit > Alternative Text
  - **Instagram:** Advanced Settings > Write Alt Text (or edit after posting)
  - **LinkedIn:** Click the image while composing > Alt text

**For video:**

- Add captions (not just auto-generated — review for accuracy)
- Provide audio description for essential visual content if needed

## Procurement and Third-Party Tools

### What should I do when purchasing software or services?

When procuring technology products or services:

1. **Include accessibility requirements** in RFPs and contracts
2. **Request accessibility documentation** from vendors — Ask for accessibility conformance reports or documentation that addresses WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
3. **Evaluate accessibility claims** — Look for "Supports" not just "Partially Supports"
4. **Request a demo** of accessibility features
5. **Test with assistive technology** if possible

**References:**

- <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IITAA Procurement Guidance</a> — Illinois-specific procurement requirements
- <a href="https://www.section508.gov/buy/define-accessibility-criteria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section508.gov: Define Accessibility Criteria</a> — Federal guidance on procurement

### What contract language should I use?

Illinois DoIT recommends including language similar to:

> "All information technology, including electronic information, software, systems, and equipment, developed or provided under this contract or procurement must comply with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (30 ILCS 587) Standards as published at <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa</a>"

### What is a VPAT? What is an ACR or MCAR?

{new:2025-12-27}

**Quick answer:** A **VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** is a standardized form vendors fill out to describe how their product meets accessibility standards. An **ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report)** is the completed VPAT — the actual document you request from vendors. **MCAR** stands for **Manufacturer's Conformance Accessibility Report**, which is essentially the same thing.

**Full explanation:**

**VPAT = the blank form; ACR = the completed report.** These terms are often used interchangeably, but technically:

- **VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** — The blank template created by the IT Industry Council (ITI) that provides a standard format for documenting accessibility conformance
- **ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report)** — The completed document a vendor provides, showing how their specific product meets (or doesn't meet) accessibility standards
- **MCAR (Manufacturer's Conformance Accessibility Report)** — Another term for ACR, emphasizing that it comes from the manufacturer/vendor

**What a VPAT/ACR tells you:**

1. **Which standard is evaluated** — Look for WCAG 2.1 Level AA (the current requirement)
2. **Conformance level for each criterion** — Common ratings include:
   - **Supports** — Fully meets the criterion
   - **Partially Supports** — Meets some but not all aspects
   - **Does Not Support** — Fails to meet the criterion
   - **Not Applicable** — Criterion doesn't apply to this product
3. **Remarks and explanations** — Details on how conformance is achieved or what barriers exist

**How to use VPATs in procurement:**

1. **Request a current VPAT/ACR** — Ask for one dated within the last 12 months
2. **Check the version** — Ensure it covers the exact product and version you're purchasing
3. **Look for "Supports"** — Products with many "Partially Supports" or "Does Not Support" ratings may require accessible alternatives
4. **Ask about remediation** — If issues exist, ask the vendor for a remediation timeline
5. **Include in contracts** — Require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance and ongoing accessibility support

**Where to find VPATs:**

- Check the vendor's website (often under "Accessibility" or "Legal")
- Request directly from your sales representative
- Search the <a href="https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITI VPAT template page</a> for the latest template version

**Red flags in a VPAT:**

- Very old date (more than 12-18 months)
- Wrong product version
- Many "Does Not Support" ratings for critical criteria
- Vague or missing explanations
- No commitment to remediation

**The bottom line:** Always request a current VPAT/ACR before purchasing technology. It won't guarantee accessibility, but it's your first line of defense against buying inaccessible tools.

## About This FAQ

### Why is this FAQ so long?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** Accessibility touches every role and content type. This FAQ is comprehensive so you can find answers specific to your situation without searching multiple sources.

**Full explanation:**

Accessibility requirements apply differently depending on whether you're a content creator, web developer, manager, or procurement officer — and whether you're working on websites, documents, videos, or third-party tools. Rather than creating separate guides for each audience, this FAQ consolidates everything in one searchable reference.

**How to use this FAQ efficiently:**

- **Start with the [Quick Reference](#quick-reference-critical-actions-by-role)** at the top — critical actions for each role
- **Jump to your role** — [Content creators](#getting-started-i-m-a-content-creator-where-do-i-start) | [Web developers](#getting-started-i-m-a-web-developer-where-do-i-start) | [Managers](#getting-started-i-m-a-manager-where-do-i-start)
- **Search (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F)** for specific topics
- **Follow "See also" links** for related questions
- **Use it as a reference** — don't try to read it all at once

**Key takeaway:** You don't need to read everything. Find your role, focus on what applies to your work, and look up specific questions as they arise.

### My learning style isn't reading dense FAQs — I need to talk to someone. Who can I ask?

{new:2026-01-02}

**Questions are welcome, and there are many ways to learn.** If your learning style is conversation, coaching, or hands-on practice (not reading dense text), that's valid — and you can still make progress quickly. This FAQ exists to *simplify* and centralize the requirements (ADA Title II + IITAA + WCAG 2.1 AA) so you don't have to interpret the legal and technical source documents alone.

**Pragmatic reality (said kindly):** We can absolutely support different learning styles — but the compliance timeline stays the same. The April 24, 2026 compliance deadline still applies — so the goal is to get you to the right person fast and start making changes while you learn.

**Who to contact for what:**

| Question Type                                      | Who to Ask                                            | Contact                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Agency-wide strategy, scope, timeline**          | Your accessibility coordinator or executive staff     | (Check with your agency)        |
| **IITAA and ADA Title II compliance requirements** | Illinois DoIT Office of Information Accessibility     | DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov |
| **Practical how-to (websites, testing, tools)**    | Your web development team                             | (Check with your agency)        |
| **Document accessibility (Word, PDF, PPT)**        | Trained content creators or accessibility coordinator | (Check with your agency)        |

**Other learning formats:**

- **Videos:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/title-ii-primer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA.gov Title II Primer</a> | <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/videos/standards-and-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C Accessibility Introduction</a>
- **Hands-on:** <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Try WAVE on any website</a> | <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download NVDA (free screen reader)</a>
- **Courses:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT Training</a> | <a href="https://www.section508.gov/training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section508.gov Training</a>

**Bottom line:** Use the learning format that works for you — conversation included — but start the work now. The deadline applies regardless of learning style.

### Why is there suddenly a deadline for digital accessibility?

**The deadline exists because the federal government finalized specific requirements on April 24, 2024.** The ADA Title II web accessibility rule establishes, for the first time, **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) with **firm deadlines** for state and local governments.

**What changed:**

- **Before April 2024:** Accessibility was required in principle, but enforcement was inconsistent and standards were vague. Agencies knew they should be accessible, but there were no specific technical requirements or firm deadlines.

- **After April 2024:** There are now **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) and **firm compliance deadlines** (April 24, 2026 for entities with populations of 50,000 or more). This creates clear accountability with testable criteria.

**Illinois already had requirements:** The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) has required accessible digital content since 2008. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and many agencies weren't fully aware of their obligations. The new federal rule adds another layer of accountability with a firm deadline.

**References:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a> — Official DOJ summary
- <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IITAA History and Requirements</a> — Illinois requirements since 2008

### What does the April 2026 deadline cover?

**Everything digital and public-facing.** The deadline applies to all public-facing digital content, not just websites:

- **Websites and web applications** — All pages and interactive features.
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations.
- **Multimedia** — Videos (must have captions), audio (must have transcripts).
- **Mobile apps** — Any apps provided to the public.
- **Social media** — Posts, images, and videos shared on social platforms (going forward).
- **Third-party content** — Embedded tools, maps, dashboards, widgets provided through contracts.

**Why the scope is so broad:** Government services have moved online rapidly, especially since 2020. What used to be in-person services are now digital, making digital accessibility essential for equal access.

**Reference:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Covered Content</a> (see section on "What Web Content and Mobile Apps Are Covered")

However, all content is sourced to official references (DOJ, Illinois DoIT, W3C/WCAG) that you can verify independently. See: [This website was generated by a web developer not on executive staff. Why should I trust this information?](#common-concerns-this-website-was-generated-by-a-web-developer-not-on-executive-staff-why-should-i-trust-this-information)

**Key takeaway:** This FAQ is updated regularly as needs arise. Recent additions are marked "NEW" for 10 days. Check the last-updated date at the top and bottom for the most recent revision.

### Why are ICJIA staff creating this FAQ? Shouldn't DoIT handle accessibility information?

{new:2025-12-31}

**Quick answer:** DoIT provides official guidance and training, and the legal requirements come from IITAA and the ADA Title II web rule. ICJIA staff created this FAQ as an ICJIA-specific, plain-language companion to help colleagues across roles stay oriented to the compliance deadlines and apply the requirements in day-to-day work.

**Full explanation:**

**Why ICJIA staff took the initiative:**

ICJIA staff across roles (including people doing day-to-day remediation work) have been attending DoIT accessibility seminars, reviewing official guidance, and applying accessibility standards across ICJIA websites and content. Like many agencies, keeping sustained attention on accessibility work alongside competing priorities can be difficult. This FAQ is a practical step to support shared understanding and consistent action across ICJIA—something staff can read, assess, and use immediately.

**This FAQ complements (doesn't replace) official sources:**

| Official Source                 | What It Provides                                        | This FAQ's Role                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Illinois DoIT Accessibility** | State-level guidance, training, IITAA requirements      | Translates DoIT guidance into ICJIA-specific context          |
| **IITAA Compliance Guidelines** | Illinois state accessibility standards and requirements | Explains how IITAA applies to ICJIA's specific content types  |
| **ADA Title II Web Rule**       | Federal requirements, deadlines, technical standards    | Clarifies federal requirements in practical, actionable terms |

**What this FAQ adds:**

1. **ICJIA-specific context** — Addresses questions that come up specifically at ICJIA (see: [ICJIA-Specific Information](#icjia-specific-information))
2. **Role-based entry points** — Organized so content creators, web developers, managers, and executive staff can find what they need quickly (see: [Getting Started](#getting-started))
3. **Practical workflows** — Step-by-step guidance for common tasks like making documents accessible (see: [Content Accessibility](#content-accessibility-documents-pdfs-presentations))
4. **Consolidated reference** — One place to find answers without navigating multiple government websites

**The goal:**

This FAQ isn't meant to replace DoIT's resources or official guidance. Instead, it's designed to:

- **Heighten awareness** about accessibility requirements across ICJIA
- **Make compliance requirements accessible** to staff who may not have time to read through multiple government websites
- **Provide practical, actionable guidance** that ICJIA staff can apply immediately
- **Support agency-wide compliance** by making accessibility information easier to find and understand
- **Support ICJIA's DEIA mission** — Accessibility is how DEIA commitments become real in digital work (see: [How does digital accessibility and compliance fit into an agency's DEIA mission?](#understanding-accessibility-how-does-digital-accessibility-and-compliance-fit-into-an-agency-s-deia-mission))

**See also:**

**Key takeaway:** ICJIA staff created this FAQ to support agency-wide accessibility compliance by making it easier for colleagues to find, understand, and apply official requirements in ICJIA’s day-to-day work.

### What if I find incorrect information in this FAQ?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** Contact the ICJIA web development team immediately. Since all claims are sourced to official references, discrepancies should be rare — but if you find one, it needs to be corrected promptly.

**What to do if you spot an error:**

1. **Verify the source** — Check the linked reference (DOJ, Illinois DoIT, W3C/WCAG) to confirm the discrepancy
2. **Note the specific issue** — What question/answer is incorrect? What should it say? What's your source?
3. **Contact the web development team** — Report the issue so it can be corrected

**Common reasons for apparent discrepancies:**

- **Outdated guidance** — Accessibility standards evolve; if federal or state guidance has changed recently, let us know
- **Interpretation differences** — Sometimes guidance is ambiguous. If you have conflicting information from DoIT or another authoritative source, share it
- **Context missing** — Some answers are simplified for brevity. If more context would help, suggest additions

**Why accuracy matters:**

The goal of this FAQ is to help ICJIA staff understand accessibility requirements. If there's incorrect information, it could lead to compliance issues or wasted effort. Corrections are taken seriously and implemented promptly.

**Key takeaway:** Every claim in this FAQ is sourced to official references, but errors can happen. If you spot one, report it so it can be fixed quickly.

### This FAQ tells me what I must do. Can the tone be more collaborative?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** You're right to raise this. The FAQ uses direct language ("must," "required," "need to") because these are legal obligations with a firm deadline — but if the tone isn't working, speak up now. Contact executive staff, your agency accessibility coordinator, or the web development team. Don't wait. If something needs to change, initiate that conversation.

**Why the direct language exists:**

The April 24, 2026 deadline and WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements come from federal and state law — not from this FAQ, not from web developers, not from internal policy. The FAQ reflects those legal obligations as clearly as possible. When it says "you must add alt text to images," that's because the law requires it for compliance, not because someone is giving orders.

**What we're trying to convey (vs. what it might sound like):**

| What It Might Sound Like    | What We Actually Mean                                                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "You must do this now"      | "The law requires this by April 2026 — let's figure out how together."      |
| "This is non-negotiable"    | "The deadline is firm, but we have choices about how we approach the work." |
| "Follow these instructions" | "Here's what works based on accessibility standards and experience."        |

**What this FAQ is NOT:**

- **Not ICJIA policy or directives** — It explains federal (ADA Title II) and state (IITAA) requirements that apply to all Illinois agencies.
- **Not telling anyone what to do** — It provides information about legal requirements and practical approaches.
- **Not a substitute for conversation** — Dialogue, questions, and collaborative problem-solving are essential.
- **Not saying "do it my way"** — Multiple approaches can work; these are tested practices, not the only practices.

**If the tone isn't working — be proactive:**

Don't wait for someone else to fix this. If the FAQ's language feels like directives rather than support, or if it's creating resistance rather than collaboration, that's a problem that needs addressing. Here's what to do:

1. **Contact executive staff** — If the overall approach or tone needs organizational discussion.
2. **Contact your accessibility coordinator** — They can address concerns about how accessibility is being communicated across the agency.
3. **Contact the web development team** — They created this FAQ and can revise specific language, add clarifications, or adjust the framing.
4. **Be specific** — Which sections feel overly directive? What alternative language would work better while maintaining accuracy?
5. **Suggest improvements** — If you see ways to make this more collaborative while keeping it clear and actionable, speak up.

**Why collaboration matters:**

Accessibility compliance is a team effort. No one person dictates how it gets done. The FAQ provides a shared foundation of information, but the actual work requires ongoing dialogue, coordination, and mutual support across all roles and levels.

**Be direct and proactive about what you need based on the information in this FAQ:**

Different people can help with different aspects. Reach out. Request specifics.

- **Agency web developers and content creators** — They can answer practical questions about implementing accessibility in your day-to-day work. They've attended DoIT seminars, work with accessibility standards regularly, and can help you understand how to apply the requirements to your specific content or projects.
- **Executive staff** — They can clarify organizational goals, priorities, and initiatives related to accessibility. If you need strategic direction or resource allocation decisions, executive staff can provide that context.
- **Agency accessibility coordinators** — They work with DoIT on compliance requirements and can address questions about official guidance, training opportunities, and how IITAA and ADA Title II requirements apply to your agency's specific situation.

**If you need something specific:**

- More conversation and less documentation? Initiate that request with executive staff or your accessibility coordinator.
- The "why" explained before the "how"? Ask your accessibility coordinator or web developers.
- Collaborative problem-solving rather than step-by-step instructions? Request that approach from your manager or accessibility coordinator.
- Better ways to approach accessibility work at ICJIA? Propose them to executive staff or your accessibility coordinator.

**Key takeaway:** If this FAQ feels more directive than supportive, say so. Accessibility compliance works best through collaboration and clear support. Contact executive staff, your accessibility coordinator, or the web development team — and help make this resource work better for everyone.

## ICJIA-Specific Information

This section contains information specific to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority (ICJIA). If you work for a different Illinois state agency, the general principles apply, but the specific resources and contacts may differ.

### ICJIA has many public sites. Where can I see the audit reports for each site?

{new:2025-12-30}

**Quick answer:** ICJIA web developers are methodically adding accessibility reports for each public site. Look for an "Accessibility Report" link in the footer of ICJIA websites.

**Available reports:**

Additional reports will be added as sites are audited and remediated.

**How to find reports:**

- **Look in the footer** — Most ICJIA sites will have an "Accessibility Report" link in the footer.
- **Reports are site-specific** — Each website has its own report documenting that site's accessibility status.

**Important limitations:**

- **Website reports only** — These reports use <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a> to test websites (HTML, navigation, forms). They do NOT cover PDFs, Word documents, Excel files, or other content files.
- **Content creator responsibility** — If you create documents, you're responsible for making them accessible. See: [Do all documents need to be accessible?](#content-accessibility-documents-pdfs-presentations-do-all-documents-need-to-be-accessible)
- **Automated testing limits** — Manual testing with keyboard navigation and screen readers is still required for full compliance.

### How do we handle accessibility complaints?

{new:2025-12-31}

**Quick answer:** This process is being finalized with the accessibility coordinator. The information below is provisional and will be updated once the formal complaint handling procedure is established.

**Provisional guidance (pending coordinator review):**

**If someone reports an accessibility barrier:**

1. **Acknowledge promptly** — Thank the person for reporting and let them know you're looking into it
2. **Document the issue** — Record what barrier was reported, where it occurs, and contact information if provided
3. **Assess and prioritize** — Determine severity (complete blocker vs. inconvenience) and which content/system is affected
4. **Route to appropriate team** — Website issues → web developers; document issues → content owner; third-party tools → procurement/vendor contact
5. **Provide timeline** — Give the reporter an estimate of when they can expect resolution or follow-up
6. **Track resolution** — Document what was fixed and when

**What constitutes a complaint vs. a request:**

| Type                         | Example                                                        | Initial Response                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Complaint/barrier report** | "I can't access [specific content] because [specific barrier]" | Prioritize investigation and resolution                |
| **Accommodation request**    | "I need [specific format] for [specific document]"             | Provide alternative format while addressing root cause |
| **General feedback**         | "Your website is hard to use"                                  | Thank them and ask for specific examples               |

**For formal ADA complaints:**

Under ADA Title II, individuals may file complaints with the U.S. Department of Justice or pursue private legal action. If your agency receives a formal complaint:

1. **Notify executive staff immediately** — This requires leadership involvement
2. **Contact your agency's legal counsel** — They will guide the formal response
3. **Document everything** — Preserve records of the complaint, your accessibility efforts, and any communication
4. **Coordinate with the accessibility coordinator** — They should be involved in the response

**The goal:** Treat accessibility reports as service improvement opportunities, not as problems to defend against. Most people who report barriers just want to access the service — they're not looking for legal action.

**This section will be updated** once ICJIA's accessibility coordinator establishes the formal complaint handling procedure. Contact the accessibility coordinator for the current process.

## Glossary

**Confused by the jargon?** Here are plain-language definitions of common accessibility terms used throughout these FAQs:

### Legal and Standards Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)** — Federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. **Title I** covers employment accommodations. **Title II** covers public services and requires state and local governments to make digital content accessible. <a href="https://www.ada.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about ADA</a>

**ADA Title II Web Rule** — The 2024 Department of Justice rule that requires state and local governments to meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards for public-facing digital content by April 24, 2026 (for entities with populations of 50,000+). <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read the ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a>

**IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** — Illinois state law (30 ILCS 587) requiring Illinois state agencies and universities to ensure their digital content is accessible to people with disabilities. Current standards require **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance. <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about IITAA</a>

**Section 504** — Part of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that requires organizations receiving federal funding to ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities. <a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/section-504/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about Section 504</a>

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)** — International standards published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that explain how to make digital content accessible. Think of them as a detailed checklist for making websites, documents, and apps usable by everyone. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more about WCAG</a>

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA** — The specific accessibility standard required by both IITAA and ADA Title II. "Level AA" means meeting both Level A (minimum) and Level AA (standard) criteria. This is the compliance target for all public-facing digital content. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View WCAG 2.1 Level AA Quick Reference</a>

### Procurement Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report)** — The completed document a vendor provides showing how their product meets (or doesn't meet) accessibility standards. This is the actual report you request from vendors — the filled-out version of a VPAT. <a href="https://www.section508.gov/sell/how-to-create-acr-with-vpat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn how to create an ACR</a>

**MCAR (Manufacturer's Conformance Accessibility Report)** — Another term for ACR, emphasizing that it comes from the manufacturer/vendor. Essentially the same as ACR.

**VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** — The blank template created by the IT Industry Council (ITI) that provides a standard format for documenting accessibility conformance. Vendors fill out VPATs to create ACRs. <a href="https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download VPAT template</a>

**VPAT ratings** — Common ratings in VPATs/ACRs include:

- **Supports** — Fully meets the criterion
- **Partially Supports** — Meets some but not all aspects
- **Does Not Support** — Fails to meet the criterion
- **Not Applicable** — Criterion doesn't apply to this product

### Technical Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**Alt text (Alternative text)** — A brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who can't see the image. Example: "Director Smith presenting award to Officer Jones at the annual ceremony." Best practice: Keep concise (roughly 15-25 words), though modern screen readers handle longer text when needed.

**ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** — Code attributes that provide additional information to screen readers when standard HTML isn't enough. Think of it as labels and instructions for assistive technology. Web developers typically handle ARIA implementation. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about ARIA Authoring Practices</a>

**Assistive technology** — Tools people with disabilities use to access digital content. Examples: screen readers (read content aloud), screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, alternative keyboards, switch devices.

**Captions** — Text displayed on screen that shows what's being said in a video. Different from subtitles (which assume you can hear) — captions also describe important sounds like "[door slams]" or "[music playing]." Required for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about captions</a>

**Color contrast ratio** — A measure of how readable text is against its background. WCAG 2.1 Level AA requires:

- **4.5:1** for normal text (smaller than 18pt regular or 14pt bold)
- **3:1** for large text (18pt+ regular or 14pt+ bold)
  <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test color contrast with WebAIM Contrast Checker</a>

**Focus indicator** — The visual outline that shows which element on a page is currently selected when navigating with a keyboard (usually by pressing Tab). Should be clearly visible so keyboard users know where they are.

**Heading structure** — Using proper heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) instead of just making text bold or larger. Screen readers use headings to navigate documents and web pages. Example: Use "Heading 1" for main titles, "Heading 2" for major sections, not just "Bold" formatting. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about heading structure</a>

**Keyboard navigation** — The ability to access and use all website features using only a keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, arrow keys) without a mouse. Required for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

**Screen reader** — Software that reads digital content aloud for people who are blind or have low vision. Common screen readers include <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVDA</a> (free, Windows), <a href="https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JAWS</a> (Windows), and VoiceOver (built into Mac/iOS).

**Transcript** — A written version of spoken audio content. Required for audio-only content (like podcasts) under WCAG 2.1 Level AA. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn about transcripts</a>

### Content-Specific Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**Accessible document** — A document (Word, PDF, PowerPoint, Excel) that has proper structure (headings, not just bold text), alt text for images, readable tables, and other features that make it usable by assistive technologies. <a href="https://www.section508.gov/create/documents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn how to create accessible documents</a>

**Accessible template** — A document template (Word, PowerPoint, etc.) that's already set up with proper heading styles, accessible fonts, sufficient color contrast, and other accessibility features built in.

**Remediation** — The process of fixing inaccessible content to make it accessible. Example: Adding alt text to images, fixing heading structure, adding captions to videos.

**Semantic HTML** — HTML code that uses the correct elements for their intended purpose (e.g., `<button>` for buttons, `<nav>` for navigation, `<heading>` for headings). This helps screen readers understand the structure and purpose of content.

### Process Terms

{new:2025-12-27}

**Automated testing** — Using software tools (like <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE</a>, <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe DevTools</a>, Lighthouse) to automatically scan for accessibility issues. These tools catch many problems but can't detect everything — manual testing is also required. <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT Testing Resources</a>

**Manual testing** — Testing accessibility by actually using assistive technologies (keyboard navigation, screen readers) or checking things manually (color contrast, zoom testing). Required because automated tools miss many issues. <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illinois DoIT Testing Resources</a>

**Prioritization** — The process of deciding which accessibility issues to fix first when you can't fix everything at once. Typically based on impact: high-traffic content, critical services, and complete blockers come first.

**VPAT/ACR review** — The process of evaluating a vendor's accessibility documentation (VPAT/ACR) to determine if their product meets your accessibility requirements before purchasing.
