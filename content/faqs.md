# Digital Accessibility FAQ for Illinois State Agency Employees

A practical guide to common accessibility questions for staff at Illinois state agencies.

---

## General Accessibility Questions

### What is digital accessibility?

Digital accessibility means that websites, applications, documents, and other digital content are designed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, or alternative keyboards.

### Why does accessibility matter?

Accessibility matters for several reasons:

- **Legal compliance** — Federal and state laws require accessible digital content
- **Equal access** — Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. have a disability
- **Better user experience** — Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **Broader reach** — Accessible content can be used by more people in more situations

### Isn't accessibility just an IT issue? Shouldn't the web team fix all these issues?

**No, accessibility is not just an IT issue.** While web developers and IT staff play crucial roles, achieving and maintaining accessibility requires collaboration across all units within an organization. Accessibility is everyone's responsibility.

**Why accessibility requires organization-wide effort:**

1. **Content creators** — Writers, editors, and content managers must:
   - Write clear, descriptive alt text for images
   - Use proper heading structure in documents
   - Create meaningful link text (not "click here")
   - Ensure color isn't the only way to convey information
   - Add captions to videos or coordinate captioning

2. **Designers** — Graphic designers and UX designers must:
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Design with keyboard navigation in mind
   - Create focus indicators for interactive elements
   - Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning
   - Design forms with proper labels and error messages

3. **Procurement staff** — Purchasing and contract managers must:
   - Include accessibility requirements in RFPs and contracts
   - Request accessibility documentation from vendors
   - Evaluate third-party tools for accessibility before purchase
   - Ensure contract language mandates WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

4. **Project managers and program staff** — Must:
   - Include accessibility in project timelines and budgets
   - Coordinate accessibility testing throughout development
   - Ensure accessibility is considered from project start, not as an afterthought
   - Verify that deliverables meet accessibility standards before launch

5. **IT and web development teams** — Must:
   - Implement accessible code and markup
   - Test with assistive technologies
   - Fix technical accessibility barriers
   - Maintain accessible infrastructure and platforms

6. **Leadership and management** — Must:
   - Allocate resources for accessibility training and tools
   - Establish accessibility policies and procedures
   - Support organization-wide accessibility initiatives
   - Ensure compliance with legal requirements

**The problem with "IT-only" thinking:**

- **Content issues** — If content creators don't write proper alt text or use heading styles, developers can't fix it retroactively without recreating content
- **Design issues** — If designs don't meet contrast requirements or lack focus indicators, developers may need to redesign rather than just code
- **Procurement issues** — If inaccessible tools are purchased, IT may be unable to make them accessible without vendor support
- **Timeline and cost** — Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically 3-10 times more expensive than building accessibility in from the start

**Best practice:** Adopt a "shift-left" approach — consider accessibility at every stage: planning, design, content creation, development, and procurement. This prevents costly retrofitting and ensures better outcomes.

### What is WCAG?

WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These are international standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that explain how to make digital content accessible. WCAG is organized around four principles (POUR):

- **Perceivable** — Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Operable** — Interface components must be operable by all users
- **Understandable** — Information and operation must be understandable
- **Robust** — Content must work with current and future technologies

**Learn more:** <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/</a>

### What does "WCAG 2.1 Level AA" mean?

WCAG has three conformance levels:

- **Level A** — Minimum accessibility (must meet)
- **Level AA** — Standard accessibility (should meet) ← _Required for Illinois_
- **Level AAA** — Enhanced accessibility (may meet where feasible)

Illinois requires Level AA conformance, which includes all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

## ICJIA-Specific Questions

### Why does ICJIA need to worry about digital accessibility? What does the April 2026 deadline mean for us?

**As an Illinois state agency, ICJIA has legal obligations under both state and federal law to ensure our digital content is accessible.** The April 24, 2026 compliance deadline is not optional — it's a legal requirement that applies directly to ICJIA.

**Why this matters for ICJIA specifically:**

1. **We're a state agency** — ICJIA falls under the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA), which has required accessible digital content since 2008. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 2024) require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

2. **We serve the public** — ICJIA's mission involves providing information, research, and resources to Illinois residents, criminal justice professionals, and the public. Under ADA Title II, all public-facing digital content must be accessible to people with disabilities.

3. **Millions of Illinois residents need accessible digital content** — According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC data</a>, approximately **1 in 4 adults in the United States** have some type of disability. In Illinois, this represents over 2.3 million people. Common disabilities include mobility limitations, cognitive difficulties, hearing difficulties, and vision impairment. Many of these individuals rely on accessible digital content to access government services and information. When ICJIA's websites or documents aren't accessible, we're potentially excluding millions of Illinoisans from critical criminal justice information and resources.

4. **Federal funding** — ICJIA receives federal grants. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that any organization receiving federal funding ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities.

5. **The April 2026 deadline is firm** — The U.S. Department of Justice's ADA Title II web accessibility rule (published April 24, 2024) requires state and local governments with populations of 50,000 or more to achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance by **April 24, 2026**. Illinois has over 12 million residents, so this deadline applies to all state agencies including ICJIA.

**What "compliance" actually means:**

- All public-facing web pages must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- All public-facing documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint) must be accessible
- Videos must have captions; audio must have transcripts
- Third-party tools and embedded content we provide must be accessible
- Social media posts going forward must be accessible

**What happens if we don't comply:**

- The DOJ can investigate and pursue enforcement actions
- Individuals can file complaints or lawsuits
- ICJIA could face legal costs, remediation costs, and reputational harm
- Most importantly, people with disabilities would be unable to access our information and services

**The reality of digital accessibility now:**

Accessibility is no longer just "best practice" — it's the law. The 2026 deadline creates accountability for what has always been the right thing to do. For ICJIA, this means integrating accessibility into every aspect of our digital presence: websites, documents, social media, and any tools we provide to the public.

**The good news:** Many accessibility improvements also benefit everyone — clearer content, better-organized documents, and more usable websites make information easier to find and understand for all users.

**References:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Fact Sheet</a> — Plain language summary of requirements and deadlines

### If this has been a requirement, why hasn't ICJIA been doing this all along?

**Actually, ICJIA's web team has been building accessible websites for years.** The web developers at ICJIA have been incorporating accessibility best practices into our websites across multiple administrations — this isn't new to them.

**What the web team has been doing:**

- Building websites with semantic HTML structure for screen reader compatibility
- Implementing keyboard navigation and focus management
- Using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where needed
- Following color contrast guidelines
- Adding alt text to images on websites
- Structuring content with proper heading hierarchies
- Testing with accessibility tools and screen readers

**But here's what's critical to understand:**

The web team is responsible for **website accessibility** — not **content accessibility**. These are two very different things:

| Area                      | Responsibility                                                          | Who Does This                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Website accessibility** | Code, navigation, structure, forms, interactive features                | Web team                                           |
| **Content accessibility** | Documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint), videos, images, social media | Content creators (COMMS, R&A, FSGU, program staff) |

**Why content accessibility requires a different approach:**

While the compliance standard is the same (WCAG 2.1 Level AA), **the tools, skills, and workflows for content accessibility are completely different** from what the web team uses:

- **Web accessibility** uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, screen reader testing, and web-specific tools like WAVE and axe DevTools
- **Document accessibility** requires Microsoft Office accessibility features, Adobe Acrobat Pro, PDF remediation tools, and document-specific testing like PAC 2024
- **Video accessibility** needs captioning software, transcript creation, and audio description tools
- **Social media accessibility** involves platform-specific alt text features, caption tools, and accessible content practices

The web team can't make your PDFs accessible for you. They can't add alt text to images you upload. They can't caption your videos. These tasks require **content creators** to learn and apply accessibility practices using tools designed for their specific workflows.

**So what's actually new?**

The difference now isn't that accessibility suddenly matters — it's that there's a **firm legal deadline with specific technical standards**. Before the April 2024 ADA Title II rule:

- Accessibility was a best practice, but enforcement was inconsistent
- There were no specific technical standards mandated by federal law for state agencies
- Compliance was measured against general principles rather than testable criteria
- There was no countdown clock creating organizational urgency

**The April 2026 deadline changes the landscape:**

Now there are specific, testable requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) with a firm compliance date. This creates accountability that didn't exist before — and extends beyond websites to include documents, videos, social media, and all public-facing digital content.

**Why this matters for you:**

If you create content — reports, presentations, social media posts, videos, PDFs, or any public-facing documents — **you** are responsible for making that content accessible. The web team can share what they know about accessibility principles, but the actual work of making content accessible falls to the people creating that content: Communications, Research & Analysis, FSGU, and other units that publish materials.

**The bottom line:** ICJIA's web team has been doing website accessibility for years. What's new is the deadline that now applies to **all content creators**. The compliance standard is the same, but the tools and skills needed for document, video, and social media accessibility are different from web development — and that work belongs to the people creating the content.

### How does digital accessibility and compliance fit into an agency's DEIA mission?

**Digital accessibility is the natural evolution of the "A" in DEIA — and it's now backed by legal requirements that give accessibility commitments real accountability.**

Many state and local government agencies have long been committed to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) principles, and accessibility has always been part of that commitment. What's evolving is how we define and measure accessibility in an increasingly digital world — and the legal standards that now apply to our online presence.

**What's changed:**

The digital transformation of government services means that accessibility must now extend to everything agencies do online. The April 2026 ADA Title II compliance deadline transforms digital accessibility from an aspirational goal into a legal mandate. This isn't a departure from DEIA values — it's their fulfillment.

**How accessibility enhances agency missions:**

Equity is fundamental to public service — ensuring that all residents, regardless of ability, can access government information, services, and resources. When digital content isn't accessible, agencies exclude people with disabilities from:

- **Public information and services** — Reports, data dashboards, publications, and service information that affects communities
- **Grant and funding opportunities** — Organizations serving communities with higher disability rates need equal access to funding opportunities and application processes
- **Public participation** — Policy discussions, public comment opportunities, and civic engagement must be accessible so that people with disabilities can participate in shaping public policy
- **Emergency and critical services** — Accessible information is essential during emergencies and for accessing critical government services

**Why this strengthens DEIA commitments:**

1. **Equity becomes measurable** — WCAG 2.1 AA standards provide concrete, testable criteria for digital equity. Agencies can now objectively assess whether their digital content truly serves everyone.

2. **Inclusion becomes actionable** — Rather than hoping content is inclusive, agencies have specific guidelines for ensuring people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities can access information.

3. **Accountability is built in** — Legal requirements mean accessibility isn't dependent on budget cycles, competing priorities, or individual champions. It's a baseline expectation.

4. **Everyone benefits** — Accessible design principles (clear language, logical structure, captions, readable fonts) improve the experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.

**The bottom line:** The 2026 deadline doesn't replace values-driven commitments to accessibility — it reinforces them. Agencies now have the legal framework, technical standards, and organizational accountability to ensure their digital presence truly reflects DEIA principles and advances equity in public service.

### Why am I just hearing about this deadline now?

**You're not alone — many people are surprised to learn about the April 2026 deadline.** There are several reasons why this may feel sudden:

**The rule is relatively new:**

The ADA Title II web accessibility rule was only finalized on **April 24, 2024** — just two years before the compliance deadline for larger entities. While digital accessibility has been a legal expectation for years (under Section 508, the IITAA, and general ADA requirements), this is the first time the Department of Justice has established **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 AA) with **firm deadlines** for state and local governments.

**Accessibility wasn't always on the radar:**

- **It wasn't prioritized** — For many organizations, accessibility was seen as a "nice to have" rather than a legal requirement
- **Limited awareness** — Unless you work in IT, web development, or disability services, accessibility requirements may not have been part of your professional development
- **No enforcement history** — Without high-profile enforcement actions, many agencies didn't feel urgency around digital accessibility

**Illinois has had requirements since 2008:**

The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) has required accessible digital content for state agencies since 2008. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and many agencies weren't fully aware of their obligations. The new federal rule adds another layer of accountability.

**What matters now:**

The countdown timer on this page shows exactly how much time remains until the compliance deadline. Rather than focusing on why we didn't know sooner, the priority now is incorporating accessibility into our workflows within this timeframe. Use the time remaining to:

- Audit existing content
- Prioritize remediation
- Build accessibility into our workflows
- Train staff on accessibility practices

**The good news:** You're learning about this with enough time to take meaningful action. Many organizations are in the same position, and resources are available to help.

### If this has been a requirement, why hasn't ICJIA been doing this all along?

**Actually, ICJIA's web team has been building accessible websites for years.** The web developers at ICJIA have been incorporating accessibility best practices into our websites across multiple administrations — this isn't new to them.

**What the web team has been doing:**

- Building websites with semantic HTML structure for screen reader compatibility
- Implementing keyboard navigation and focus management
- Using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where needed
- Following color contrast guidelines
- Adding alt text to images on websites
- Structuring content with proper heading hierarchies
- Testing with accessibility tools and screen readers

**But here's what's critical to understand:**

The web team is responsible for **website accessibility** — not **content accessibility**. These are two very different things:

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Website accessibility** | Code, navigation, structure, forms, interactive features                | Web team                                           |
| **Content accessibility** | Documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint), videos, images, social media | Content creators (COMMS, R&A, FSGU, program staff) |

**Why content accessibility requires a different approach:**

While the compliance standard is the same (WCAG 2.1 Level AA), **the tools, skills, and workflows for content accessibility are completely different** from what the web team uses:

The web team can't make your PDFs accessible for you. They can't add alt text to images you upload. They can't caption your videos. These tasks require **content creators** to learn and apply accessibility practices using tools designed for their specific workflows.

**So what's actually new?**

The difference now isn't that accessibility suddenly matters — it's that there's a **firm legal deadline with specific technical standards**. Before the April 2024 ADA Title II rule:

The compliance standard is the same, but the tools and skills needed for document, video, and social media accessibility are different from web development — and that work belongs to the people creating the content.

### What happens after April 24, 2026?

**After April 24, 2026, state and local governments must be in compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for all public-facing digital content.** Agencies that fail to meet this deadline may face several potential issues:

**Legal and enforcement consequences:**

- **Department of Justice investigations** — The DOJ can investigate complaints and pursue enforcement actions against non-compliant agencies
- **Complaints and lawsuits** — Individuals with disabilities can file complaints with the DOJ or pursue private lawsuits under the ADA
- **Legal costs and remediation expenses** — Agencies may face significant costs for legal defense, settlements, and emergency remediation of inaccessible content
- **Reputational harm** — Public awareness of accessibility failures can damage an agency's reputation and public trust

**Operational impacts:**

- **Service disruptions** — If complaints or lawsuits result in court orders, agencies may need to temporarily remove or restrict access to non-compliant content
- **Resource reallocation** — Emergency remediation efforts can divert staff time and budget from other priorities
- **Delayed projects** — New digital projects may be delayed while existing accessibility issues are addressed
- **Increased scrutiny** — Agencies with known accessibility issues may face increased oversight and reporting requirements

**What's covered by the deadline:**

The April 2026 deadline applies to all public-facing digital content, not just websites:

- **Websites** — All public-facing web pages, including forms, interactive features, and embedded content
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations published online or shared digitally
- **Mobile apps** — Any mobile applications provided to the public
- **Videos and multimedia** — All video content requires captions; audio content requires transcripts
- **Social media** — Posts, images, and videos shared on social platforms (going forward)
- **Third-party content** — Embedded maps, dashboards, widgets, and tools provided through contracts or agreements
- **Email communications** — Newsletters and other digital communications sent to the public

**The bottom line:** If it's digital and public-facing, it needs to be accessible by April 24, 2026. Agencies that start working toward compliance now have time to address issues systematically. Those that delay may face costly emergency remediation and legal consequences.

**Digital accessibility is the natural evolution of the "A" in DEIA — and it's now backed by legal requirements that give our accessibility commitment real accountability.**

ICJIA has long been committed to DEIA principles, and accessibility has always been part of that commitment. What's evolving is how we define and measure accessibility in an increasingly digital world — and the legal standards that now apply to our online presence.

The digital transformation of government services means that accessibility must now extend to everything we do online. The April 2026 ADA Title II compliance deadline transforms digital accessibility from an aspirational goal into a legal mandate. This isn't a departure from DEIA values — it's their fulfillment.

**How accessibility enhances ICJIA's mission:**

ICJIA's mission centers on improving the administration of criminal justice in Illinois through research, data, and resources. Equity is fundamental to this work — ensuring that all Illinoisans, regardless of ability, can access criminal justice information, research findings, grant opportunities, and victim services information.

- **Research and data must reach everyone** — When our research reports, data dashboards, and publications aren't accessible, we're excluding people with disabilities from evidence-based information that affects their communities.

- **Grant information must be equitable** — Organizations serving communities with higher disability rates need equal access to funding opportunities and application processes.

- **Victim services information is critical** — People with disabilities experience higher rates of victimization. Ensuring our victim services resources are accessible is directly aligned with our mission to support crime victims.

- **Criminal justice reform requires inclusive voices** — Policy discussions and public comment opportunities must be accessible so that people with disabilities can participate in shaping criminal justice policy.

**Why this strengthens our DEIA commitment:**

1. **Equity becomes measurable** — WCAG 2.1 AA standards provide concrete, testable criteria for digital equity. We can now objectively assess whether our digital content truly serves everyone.

2. **Inclusion becomes actionable** — Rather than hoping our content is inclusive, we have specific guidelines for ensuring people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities can access our information.

3. **Accountability is built in** — Legal requirements mean accessibility isn't dependent on budget cycles, competing priorities, or individual champions. It's a baseline expectation.

4. **Everyone benefits** — Accessible design principles (clear language, logical structure, captions, readable fonts) improve the experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.

**The bottom line:** The 2026 deadline doesn't replace ICJIA's values-driven commitment to accessibility — it reinforces it. We now have the legal framework, technical standards, and organizational accountability to ensure our digital presence truly reflects our DEIA principles and advances our mission of equity in criminal justice.

- All state departments, divisions, and agencies
- Constitutional offices
- Public universities

The IITAA does **not** directly apply to:

- Local governments
- School districts
- Community colleges
- Private organizations

**Note:** Local governments and school districts still have obligations under ADA Title II.

### What does the IITAA cover?

The IITAA covers all "information and communication technology," including:

- Websites and web applications
- Software and desktop applications
- Mobile applications
- Electronic documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)

## ADA Title II Web Rule

### What is the ADA Title II web accessibility rule?

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule establishing specific technical requirements for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rule requires state and local governments to make their public-facing digital content meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official fact sheet:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>

### When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?

| Entity Size                  | Compliance Deadline |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Population of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Population less than 50,000  | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026**.

### Does ADA Title II apply to internal documents?

**No, the ADA Title II web rule does not directly apply to purely internal content.** The rule specifically covers "services, programs, and activities provided or made available" to the public.

**However**, internal content may still need to be accessible under:

- **ADA Title I** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which could include making internal systems accessible
- **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities
- **IITAA** — Illinois law covers intranets and internal systems used by state employees

**Best practice:** Make internal documents accessible proactively. It's easier than retrofitting later, and you may have employees with disabilities who need access.

### What content is covered by the ADA Title II rule?

The rule covers all web content and mobile apps that state and local governments provide or make available to the public, including:

- Websites and web applications
- Mobile apps
- Online documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Online forms and applications
- Social media posts (going forward)
- Video and audio content
- Third-party content provided through contracts or agreements

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Covered Content</a> (see section on "What Web Content and Mobile Apps Are Covered")

### Are there any exceptions to the ADA Title II rule?

Yes, limited exceptions exist for:

1. **Archived content** — Content created before the compliance date that is not currently used for services
2. **Pre-existing documents** — Documents created before the deadline (unless used to apply for or access services)
3. **Third-party content** — Content posted by third parties not under contract
4. **Password-protected individual documents** — Documents specific to one person's account
5. **Pre-existing social media posts** — Posts made before the compliance deadline

**Important:** Even when exceptions apply, you may still need to provide accessible alternatives upon request.

### What about third-party widgets and embedded content?

You are responsible for the accessibility of third-party content that you embed or integrate into your website through contracts or agreements. This includes:

- Payment processors
- Scheduling tools
- Chat widgets
- Embedded maps
- Social media feeds
- Survey tools

**Best practice:** Request accessibility documentation from vendors before purchasing, and include accessibility requirements in contracts.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a> (see section on "Third-Party Content Provided Through Contracts or Agreements")

### Do embedded dashboards and maps (like Tableau or ArcGIS) need to be accessible?

**Yes, embedded dashboards and maps must be accessible to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements for ADA Title II compliance.** Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, you are responsible for ensuring that all third-party content you embed or integrate into your website is accessible, including data visualization tools like Tableau, mapping services like ArcGIS, and other embedded interactive content.

**Key requirements for embedded content:**

1. **Keyboard accessibility** — All interactive elements (filters, buttons, zoom controls, data points) must be operable using only a keyboard, without requiring mouse interaction.

2. **Screen reader compatibility** — Content must be readable by screen readers, with proper labels, descriptions, and alternative text for visual elements.

3. **Color contrast** — Text and interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components).

4. **Alternative formats** — Provide accessible alternatives when embedded content cannot be made fully accessible:
   - Data tables or CSV exports for dashboards
   - Text descriptions or alternative map formats for geographic information
   - Static images with detailed alt text when interactive features aren't accessible

5. **Focus indicators** — Visible focus indicators must be present for keyboard navigation.

**What to do before embedding:**

- **Request accessibility documentation** — Ask vendors for accessibility conformance reports or documentation that specifically address WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

- **Test with assistive technology** — Test embedded content with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation before going live.

- **Include accessibility in contracts** — Specify WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements in procurement contracts and service agreements.

- **Provide alternatives** — If embedded content cannot be made fully accessible, provide equivalent accessible alternatives (e.g., downloadable data files, alternative map formats, or text descriptions).

**Vendor-specific considerations:**

- **Tableau** — Tableau has made accessibility improvements, but embedded dashboards may require configuration for full accessibility. Test thoroughly and provide data exports as alternatives.

- **ArcGIS** — ArcGIS Online and embedded maps have accessibility features, but complex interactive maps may need alternative formats. Consider providing static map images with detailed descriptions or alternative navigation methods.

**Remember:** Simply embedding third-party content does not absolve you of accessibility responsibility. If you cannot make embedded content accessible, you must provide accessible alternatives that offer equivalent functionality and information.

## Content Accessibility (Documents, PDFs, Presentations)

### What about photos ICJIA takes at events — like speeches or awards ceremonies? Do those need to be accessible?

**Yes, if you're sharing them digitally.** Any photos published on ICJIA's website, social media, or in digital documents need alt text (alternative text) that describes the image for people who can't see it.

**What is alt text?**

Alt text is a brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who are blind or have low vision. It's also displayed if an image fails to load.

**How to write good alt text for event photos:**

- **Be specific and concise** — Describe what's actually happening in the photo
- **Include relevant names** — If someone is being recognized, name them
- **Describe the context** — What event is this? What's the setting?
- **Keep it brief** — Usually 1-2 sentences is sufficient

**Examples:**

| Photo Type     | Poor Alt Text             | Good Alt Text                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Award ceremony | "Photo" or "IMG_4523.jpg" | "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe at the annual ICJIA awards ceremony" |
| Speech         | "Person speaking"         | "ICJIA Executive Director addresses attendees at the 2025 Victim Services Conference"                            |
| Group photo    | "Group of people"         | "ICJIA Research & Analysis Unit staff at the December 2025 all-hands meeting"                                    |
| Event venue    | "Conference room"         | "Attendees networking during a break at the Illinois Criminal Justice Summit"                                    |

**Where to add alt text:**

- **Website/CMS** — Look for the "alt text" or "image description" field when uploading
- **Word documents** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **PowerPoint** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **Social media** — Each platform has an alt text option (see Social Media Accessibility section)
- **Email** — Outlook and Gmail both support alt text for images

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A</a> — All non-text content must have a text alternative

### How long should alt text be?

**Aim for 125 characters or fewer** — this is about 15-25 words. Some older screen readers truncate alt text at 125 characters, and shorter descriptions are easier for users to process.

- **Maximum:** Stay under 150 characters when possible
- **Ideal:** 125 characters or less
- **Too short:** Single words like "photo" or "image" don't help anyone
- **Too long:** If you need more than 150 characters, consider whether a visible caption would work better

**The bottom line:** If you took the photo because it captures something meaningful, that meaning needs to be conveyed in alt text for people who can't see it — but keep it concise.

### How do I handle complex images like charts, graphs, or infographics?

Some images — like charts, graphs, infographics, or images containing lots of text — need more than a brief alt text. Here's how to handle them:

**For charts and graphs with data:**

1. **Alt text:** Provide a brief summary of what the chart shows (e.g., "Bar chart showing Illinois crime rates declining 15% from 2020 to 2024")
2. **Data table:** Include the underlying data in an accessible table format, either directly below the chart or linked nearby
3. **Long description:** If the trends or patterns matter, describe them in the body text

**Example for a chart:**

- **Alt text:** "Line graph showing ICJIA grant funding from 2020-2025. Full data in table below."
- **Below the image:** An accessible HTML table with the actual numbers

**For infographics or images with lots of text:**

1. **Don't use images of text** — If possible, present the information as actual text on the page instead of as an image
2. **If you must use an image:** Provide the full text content in one of these ways:
   - A "long description" link that opens the full text
   - An expandable section below the image with the complete text
   - A text summary in the body of the page

**For scanned documents or PDF images:**

1. **Best approach:** Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the image to actual text
2. **If OCR isn't possible:** Provide a text transcript of the document content
3. **Alt text:** Describe what the document is (e.g., "Scanned letter from Governor dated June 2025. Full transcript below.")

**General rule for complex images:**

- **Alt text:** Brief summary + tell users where to find more detail
- **Long description:** Provide full information in accessible text format nearby or linked

**Example patterns:**

| Image Type       | Alt Text Approach                                     | Additional Requirement    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data chart       | "Chart showing [brief conclusion]. Data table below." | Accessible data table     |
| Infographic      | "Infographic about [topic]. Full text follows."       | Complete text version     |
| Scanned document | "[Document type] from [source]. Transcript provided." | Text transcript           |
| Complex diagram  | "Diagram of [subject]. Described in detail below."    | Detailed text description |

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content</a> — Complex images need text alternatives that serve equivalent purpose
- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#images-of-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text - Level AA</a> — Avoid images of text; use actual text when possible

### How do I make images accessible on social media, Constant Contact, or Canva?

Sharing infographics, charts, or images with text on platforms like social media, Constant Contact, or Canva presents unique challenges because you often can't add data tables or long descriptions directly.

**Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn):**

- **Alt text limits vary** — Most platforms allow 100-1000 characters for alt text, but keep it concise
- **Use the post text** — Put key information in the post caption itself, not just the image
- **Link to more** — If sharing a complex infographic, link to a webpage with the full accessible version
- **Don't rely on the image alone** — If the image contains important text or data, repeat it in your post

**Example social media approach:**

- **Image:** Infographic showing "5 Steps to Accessible Documents"
- **Alt text:** "Infographic listing 5 steps to create accessible documents. Steps listed in post."
- **Post text:** "Here are 5 steps to accessible documents: 1) Use heading styles, 2) Add alt text to images, 3) Use meaningful link text, 4) Check color contrast, 5) Run accessibility checker. Full guide: [link]"

**Constant Contact and email marketing:**

- **Alt text field:** Constant Contact has an alt text field for images — use it
- **Character limit:** Keep alt text brief since email clients vary in support
- **Avoid image-only emails** — Don't put critical information only in images; many users have images disabled by default
- **Provide text version** — Key messages should appear as actual text in the email, not just in graphics

**Example email approach:**

- **Image:** Event announcement graphic with date, time, location
- **Alt text:** "ICJIA Training Event - details in text below"
- **Email body:** Include all event details as actual text below the image

**Canva:**

- **Canva supports alt text** — When you download or share, Canva can include alt text
- **Better approach:** Export important text content separately, not just as an image
- **For presentations:** Use Canva's presentation mode which supports alt text, or export to PowerPoint and add alt text there
- **For print vs. digital:** If creating something for digital distribution, consider whether it needs to be an image at all

**General rule for social/email:**

If you're sharing a complex image on social media or email, ask yourself: "If someone can't see this image, can they still get the information?" If not, you need to provide the content as text — either in the post/email body or linked to an accessible page.

### Who should write the alt text for photos?

**Ideally, the person supplying the photo should also supply the alt text.** They know what's happening in the image, who's pictured, and why it matters. If you're submitting photos for the website, a newsletter, or social media, include alt text with your submission.

- **You were there** — You know the context, the names, and what made the moment significant
- **You chose the photo** — You selected it for a reason; that reason should be in the alt text
- **It saves time** — The web team or communications staff shouldn't have to guess who's in the photo or what event it's from

**Best practice:** When submitting photos, include a simple list: "Photo 1: [alt text], Photo 2: [alt text]" etc.

### Are captions the same as alt text?

**No — captions and alt text serve different purposes and both may be needed.**

|                 | Caption                                              | Alt Text                                                            |

| **Visibility**  | Visible to everyone on the page                      | Hidden; only read by screen readers or shown if image fails to load |
| **Purpose**     | Provides context, credits, or additional information | Describes the image for people who can't see it                     |
| **Who sees it** | All users                                            | Users with screen readers, or when images don't load                |
| **Required?**   | Optional but often helpful                           | Required for accessibility                                          |

**Example of both working together:**

- **Alt text:** "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe"
- **Caption:** "Officer John Doe receives the 2025 Excellence Award for his work on community violence intervention programs. Photo: ICJIA"

The alt text describes what's visually happening. The caption adds context that all readers benefit from (what the award was for, photo credit).

**When you might skip detailed alt text:**

- **Purely decorative images** — If a photo adds no meaningful information (like a decorative border), mark it as decorative. But event photos are almost never purely decorative.
- **Caption already describes it** — If there's a visible caption that fully describes the visual content, alt text can be briefer — but alt text is still required (even if just "Award ceremony as described in caption").

### Do all documents need to be accessible?

For public-facing documents, yes. Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, conventional electronic documents must be accessible, including:

- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations

**Exceptions may apply for:**

- Pre-existing documents not currently used for services (still must provide accessible alternatives upon request)
- Password-protected documents specific to an individual's account

### How do I make a Word document accessible?

Key steps for accessible Word documents:

1. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
2. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click > Edit Alt Text
3. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
4. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**
6. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon
7. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

### How do I make a PDF accessible?

The best approach depends on the source:

**If you have the source document (Word, InDesign, etc.):**

1. Make the source document accessible first
2. Export to PDF with accessibility settings enabled
3. Check and fix any remaining issues in Adobe Acrobat Pro

**If you only have the PDF:**

1. Run the Accessibility Checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro
2. Add tags using the Reading Order tool
3. Add alt text to images
4. Set the document language
5. Verify reading order
6. Test with a screen reader

### Is Canva accessible?

Canva has made progress on accessibility features, including:

- Design Accessibility checker (checks contrast, alt text, typography)
- Automatic alt text suggestions
- Reading order and heading tagging for PDFs

**However:** Canva PDFs are not fully WCAG or PDF/UA compliant. If you use Canva:

- Use the Design Accessibility tool before exporting
- Check exported PDFs with PAC or Adobe Acrobat
- Be prepared to remediate PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Pro
- Simpler designs produce better accessibility results

### How do I make Excel spreadsheets accessible?

Key steps for accessible Excel files:

1. **Use a simple, logical structure** — Avoid blank rows/columns for spacing
2. **Name worksheets descriptively** — Not "Sheet1," "Sheet2"
3. **Define table headers** — Format as Table with header row
4. **Add alt text to charts and images**
5. **Avoid merged cells** when possible
6. **Use sufficient color contrast**
7. **Don't rely on color alone** to convey information
8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

## Social Media Accessibility

### Do social media posts need to be accessible?

Yes. Under the ADA Title II rule, new social media posts by state and local governments must meet accessibility standards. Pre-existing posts (before the compliance deadline) are exempt.

**Note:** Social media platforms themselves have accessibility limitations, but you can control the content you post.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Social Media</a> (see section on "Social Media Posts")

### How do I make social media posts accessible?

**For all platforms:**

- Write in plain language
- Use CamelCase for hashtags (#AccessibilityMatters)
- Limit emoji use; don't place multiple emojis together
- Put hashtags at the end of posts
- Keep videos captioned
- Use sufficient color contrast in graphics

**For images:**

- Add alt text (most platforms support this now)
- Don't put essential text only in images
- Describe images in the post if alt text isn't available

**For video:**

- Add captions (not just auto-generated — review for accuracy)
- Provide audio description for essential visual content if needed

### How do I add alt text on different platforms?

- **X (Twitter):** When composing, click the image > "Add description"
- **Facebook:** Click the image > Edit > Alternative Text
- **Instagram:** Advanced Settings > Write Alt Text (or edit after posting)
- **LinkedIn:** Click the image while composing > Alt text

## Procurement and Third-Party Tools

### What should I do when purchasing software or services?

When procuring technology products or services:

1. **Include accessibility requirements** in RFPs and contracts
2. **Request accessibility documentation** from vendors — Ask for accessibility conformance reports or documentation that addresses WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
3. **Evaluate accessibility claims** — Look for "Supports" not just "Partially Supports"
4. **Request a demo** of accessibility features
5. **Test with assistive technology** if possible

**IITAA procurement guidance:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html</a>

### What contract language should I use?

Illinois DoIT recommends including language similar to:

> "All information technology, including electronic information, software, systems, and equipment, developed or provided under this contract or procurement must comply with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (30 ILCS 587) Standards as published at <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa</a>"
