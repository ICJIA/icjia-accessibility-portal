# Digital Accessibility FAQ for Illinois State Agency Employees

A practical guide to common accessibility questions for staff at Illinois state agencies.

---

## General Accessibility Questions

### What is digital accessibility?

Digital accessibility means that websites, applications, documents, and other digital content are designed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, or alternative keyboards.

### Why does accessibility matter?

Accessibility matters for several reasons:

- **Legal compliance** — Federal and state laws require accessible digital content
- **Equal access** — Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. have a disability
- **Better user experience** — Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **Broader reach** — Accessible content can be used by more people in more situations

### What laws apply to Illinois state agencies?

Illinois state agencies must comply with multiple accessibility requirements:

| Law/Standard                                                  | Applies To                                       | Technical Standard       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **IITAA** (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act) | Illinois state agencies and universities         | WCAG 2.1 Level AA        |
| **ADA Title II**                                              | State and local government public-facing content | WCAG 2.1 Level AA        |
| **Section 504**                                               | Any entity receiving federal funding             | Reasonable accommodation |
| **ADA Title I**                                               | Employment/workplace accommodations              | Reasonable accommodation |

### What is WCAG?

WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These are international standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that explain how to make digital content accessible. WCAG is organized around four principles (POUR):

- **Perceivable** — Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Operable** — Interface components must be operable by all users
- **Understandable** — Information and operation must be understandable
- **Robust** — Content must work with current and future technologies

**Learn more:** https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

### What does "WCAG 2.1 Level AA" mean?

WCAG has three conformance levels:

- **Level A** — Minimum accessibility (must meet)
- **Level AA** — Standard accessibility (should meet) ← _Required for Illinois_
- **Level AAA** — Enhanced accessibility (may meet where feasible)

Illinois requires Level AA conformance, which includes all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

## Illinois-Specific Requirements (IITAA)

### What is the IITAA?

The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) requires Illinois agencies and universities to ensure that their websites, information systems, and information technologies are accessible to people with disabilities. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards require conformance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official IITAA page:** https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html

### Who must comply with the IITAA?

The IITAA applies to:

- Executive, legislative, and judicial branches of Illinois state government
- All state departments, divisions, and agencies
- Constitutional offices
- Public universities

The IITAA does **not** directly apply to:

- Local governments
- School districts
- Community colleges
- Private organizations

**Note:** Local governments and school districts still have obligations under ADA Title II.

### What does the IITAA cover?

The IITAA covers all "information and communication technology," including:

- Websites and web applications
- Software and desktop applications
- Mobile applications
- Electronic documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Multimedia (video and audio)
- Information kiosks
- Hardware with user interfaces

### When did the current IITAA standards take effect?

- **IITAA 1.0** — August 20, 2008 (original standards)
- **IITAA 2.0** — January 18, 2018 (aligned with WCAG 2.0 AA)
- **IITAA 2.1** — June 24, 2024 (aligned with WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Where can I get IITAA training?

## ADA Title II Web Rule

### What is the ADA Title II web accessibility rule?

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule establishing specific technical requirements for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rule requires state and local governments to make their public-facing digital content meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official fact sheet:** https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/

### When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?

| Entity Size                  | Compliance Deadline |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Population of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Population less than 50,000  | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026**.

### Does ADA Title II apply to internal documents?

**No, the ADA Title II web rule does not directly apply to purely internal content.** The rule specifically covers "services, programs, and activities provided or made available" to the public.

**However**, internal content may still need to be accessible under:

- **ADA Title I** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which could include making internal systems accessible
- **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities
- **IITAA** — Illinois law covers intranets and internal systems used by state employees

**Best practice:** Make internal documents accessible proactively. It's easier than retrofitting later, and you may have employees with disabilities who need access.

### What content is covered by the ADA Title II rule?

The rule covers all web content and mobile apps that state and local governments provide or make available to the public, including:

- Websites and web applications
- Mobile apps
- Online documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Online forms and applications
- Social media posts (going forward)
- Video and audio content
- Third-party content provided through contracts or agreements

### Are there any exceptions to the ADA Title II rule?

Yes, limited exceptions exist for:

1. **Archived content** — Content created before the compliance date that is not currently used for services
2. **Pre-existing documents** — Documents created before the deadline (unless used to apply for or access services)
3. **Third-party content** — Content posted by third parties not under contract
4. **Password-protected individual documents** — Documents specific to one person's account
5. **Pre-existing social media posts** — Posts made before the compliance deadline

**Important:** Even when exceptions apply, you may still need to provide accessible alternatives upon request.

## Website Accessibility

### How do I test my website for accessibility?

Use a combination of automated and manual testing:

**Automated Testing Tools (free):**

- **WAVE** — https://wave.webaim.org/ (browser extension)
- **axe DevTools** — https://www.deque.com/axe/ (browser extension)
- **ANDI** — https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html (bookmarklet)
- **Lighthouse** — Built into Chrome DevTools

**Manual Testing:**

- Keyboard navigation — Can you access everything without a mouse?
- Screen reader testing — Does content make sense when read aloud?
- Zoom testing — Does content remain usable at 200% zoom?
- Color contrast — Is text readable against its background?

**Illinois testing guidance:** https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html

### What are the most common website accessibility issues?

1. **Missing or inadequate alt text** for images
2. **Poor color contrast** between text and background
3. **Missing form labels** — form fields without associated labels
4. **Keyboard inaccessibility** — interactive elements that can't be reached or operated with a keyboard
5. **Missing or improper heading structure** — headings used for styling rather than structure
6. **Missing captions or transcripts** for video/audio content
7. **Links that don't make sense out of context** — "click here" or "read more"
8. **Missing page titles** or duplicate titles across pages
9. **Tables without proper headers** — data tables lacking row/column headers
10. **Auto-playing media** without controls

### What color contrast ratio is required?

For WCAG 2.1 Level AA:

- **Normal text** (under 18pt or 14pt bold): **4.5:1** contrast ratio
- **Large text** (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold): **3:1** contrast ratio
- **UI components and graphics**: **3:1** contrast ratio

**Check contrast:** https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/

### Do I need to caption all videos?

Yes, for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance:

- **Pre-recorded video with audio** — Requires synchronized captions
- **Live video with audio** — Requires captions (can be auto-generated with corrections)
- **Pre-recorded audio only** — Requires a text transcript
- **Video with essential visual content** — May require audio description

### What about third-party widgets and embedded content?

You are responsible for the accessibility of third-party content that you embed or integrate into your website through contracts or agreements. This includes:

- Payment processors
- Scheduling tools
- Chat widgets
- Embedded maps
- Social media feeds
- Survey tools

**Best practice:** Request a VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) from vendors before purchasing, and include accessibility requirements in contracts.

## Content Accessibility (Documents, PDFs, Presentations)

### Do all documents need to be accessible?

For public-facing documents, yes. Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, conventional electronic documents must be accessible, including:

- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations

**Exceptions may apply for:**

- Pre-existing documents not currently used for services (still must provide accessible alternatives upon request)
- Password-protected documents specific to an individual's account

### How do I make a Word document accessible?

Key steps for accessible Word documents:

1. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
2. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click > Edit Alt Text
3. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
4. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**
6. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon
7. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

**Training available from DoIT:** DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov

### How do I make a PDF accessible?

The best approach depends on the source:

**If you have the source document (Word, InDesign, etc.):**

1. Make the source document accessible first
2. Export to PDF with accessibility settings enabled
3. Check and fix any remaining issues in Adobe Acrobat Pro

**If you only have the PDF:**

1. Run the Accessibility Checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro
2. Add tags using the Reading Order tool
3. Add alt text to images
4. Set the document language
5. Verify reading order
6. Test with a screen reader

**Testing tool:** PAC 2024 (free) — https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/

**Adobe guidance:** https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/create-verify-pdf-accessibility.html

### Is Canva accessible?

Canva has made progress on accessibility features, including:

- Design Accessibility checker (checks contrast, alt text, typography)
- Automatic alt text suggestions
- Reading order and heading tagging for PDFs

**However:** Canva PDFs are not fully WCAG or PDF/UA compliant. If you use Canva:

- Use the Design Accessibility tool before exporting
- Check exported PDFs with PAC or Adobe Acrobat
- Be prepared to remediate PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Pro
- Simpler designs produce better accessibility results

### How do I make Excel spreadsheets accessible?

Key steps for accessible Excel files:

1. **Use a simple, logical structure** — Avoid blank rows/columns for spacing
2. **Name worksheets descriptively** — Not "Sheet1," "Sheet2"
3. **Define table headers** — Format as Table with header row
4. **Add alt text to charts and images**
5. **Avoid merged cells** when possible
6. **Use sufficient color contrast**
7. **Don't rely on color alone** to convey information
8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

### How do I make PowerPoint presentations accessible?

Key steps for accessible PowerPoint:

1. **Use built-in slide layouts** — Don't create from blank slides
2. **Add alt text to images, charts, and graphics**
3. **Ensure reading order is correct** — Home > Arrange > Selection Pane
4. **Use unique, descriptive slide titles**
5. **Use sufficient color contrast**
6. **Make hyperlinks descriptive**
7. **Add captions to embedded videos**
8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

## Social Media Accessibility

### Do social media posts need to be accessible?

Yes. Under the ADA Title II rule, new social media posts by state and local governments must meet accessibility standards. Pre-existing posts (before the compliance deadline) are exempt.

**Note:** Social media platforms themselves have accessibility limitations, but you can control the content you post.

### How do I make social media posts accessible?

**For all platforms:**

- Write in plain language
- Use CamelCase for hashtags (#AccessibilityMatters)
- Limit emoji use; don't place multiple emojis together
- Put hashtags at the end of posts
- Keep videos captioned
- Use sufficient color contrast in graphics

**For images:**

- Add alt text (most platforms support this now)
- Don't put essential text only in images
- Describe images in the post if alt text isn't available

**For video:**

- Add captions (not just auto-generated — review for accuracy)
- Provide audio description for essential visual content if needed

**Platform-specific guidance:** https://www.section508.gov/create/social-media/

### How do I add alt text on different platforms?

- **X (Twitter):** When composing, click the image > "Add description"
- **Facebook:** Click the image > Edit > Alternative Text
- **Instagram:** Advanced Settings > Write Alt Text (or edit after posting)
- **LinkedIn:** Click the image while composing > Alt text

## Procurement and Third-Party Tools

### What should I do when purchasing software or services?

When procuring technology products or services:

1. **Include accessibility requirements** in RFPs and contracts
2. **Request a VPAT/ACR** (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template / Accessibility Conformance Report)
3. **Evaluate the VPAT** — Look for "Supports" not just "Partially Supports"
4. **Request a demo** of accessibility features
5. **Test with assistive technology** if possible

**IITAA procurement guidance:** https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html

### What is a VPAT?

A VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) is a standardized document vendors use to describe how their product conforms to accessibility standards. The completed document is called an ACR (Accessibility Conformance Report).

**Evaluate VPATs carefully:**

- Check the date — VPATs older than 1–2 years may be outdated
- Check the version tested — Does it match what you're buying?
- Look at conformance levels (Supports, Partially Supports, Does Not Support)
- Read the remarks/explanations

**VPAT template:** https://www.itic.org/policy/accessibility/vpat

### What contract language should I use?

Illinois DoIT recommends including language similar to:

> "All information technology, including electronic information, software, systems, and equipment, developed or provided under this contract or procurement must comply with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (30 ILCS 587) Standards as published at https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa"
