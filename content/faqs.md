## General Accessibility Questions

### What is digital accessibility?

Digital accessibility means that websites, applications, documents, and other digital content are designed so that people with disabilities can use them. This includes people with visual, auditory, motor, cognitive, and neurological disabilities who may use assistive technologies like screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, or alternative keyboards.

### Why am I hearing about this deadline now? I had no idea.

**You're not alone — many people are surprised to learn about digital accessibility requirements and the April 2026 deadline.** Digital accessibility has become a critical priority because of a major shift in federal law that creates specific, enforceable requirements for state and local governments. There are several reasons why this may feel sudden:

**The game-changer: The ADA Title II Web Rule**

The ADA Title II web accessibility rule was only finalized on **April 24, 2024**, setting a compliance deadline of **April 24, 2026** for larger entities. On that date, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule that establishes **specific technical requirements** for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This is the first time the federal government has set concrete, testable standards for digital accessibility that apply directly to state and local governments.

While digital accessibility has been a legal expectation for years (under Section 508, the IITAA, and general ADA requirements), this is the first time the Department of Justice has established **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 AA) with **firm deadlines** for state and local governments.

**Official fact sheet:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a>

**What this means:**

- **Before April 2024:** Accessibility was required in principle, but enforcement was inconsistent and standards were vague. Agencies knew they should be accessible, but there were no specific technical requirements or firm deadlines. Compliance was measured against general principles rather than testable criteria, and there was no countdown clock creating organizational urgency.

- **After April 2024:** There are now **specific technical standards** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) and **firm compliance deadlines** (April 24, 2026 for most agencies). This isn't optional — it's a legal requirement with clear, testable criteria. The April 2026 deadline changes the landscape: now there are specific, testable requirements with a firm compliance date, creating accountability that didn't exist before — and extending beyond websites to include documents, videos, social media, and all public-facing digital content.

**Accessibility wasn't always on the radar:**

- **It wasn't prioritized** — For many organizations, accessibility was seen as a "nice to have" rather than a legal requirement
- **Limited awareness** — Unless you work in IT, web development, or disability services, accessibility requirements may not have been part of your professional development
- **No enforcement history** — Without high-profile enforcement actions, many agencies didn't feel urgency around digital accessibility

**Illinois has had requirements since 2008:**

The Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA) has required accessible digital content for state agencies since 2008. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and many agencies weren't fully aware of their obligations. The new federal rule adds another layer of accountability.

**Why you're hearing about it so frequently now:**

1. **The deadline is approaching** — For state and local governments with populations of 50,000 or more, the compliance deadline is **April 24, 2026**. That's less than two years away, and achieving compliance requires systematic work across all digital content. Organizations are realizing that this work needs to start now.

2. **The scope is comprehensive** — The rule covers **all public-facing digital content**: websites, mobile apps, documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint), videos, social media posts, and third-party tools. This isn't just about websites — it's about everything your agency puts online.

3. **It requires everyone's participation** — While web developers can fix technical issues (like code structure, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels), they **cannot** fix content issues. Achieving compliance requires:
   - **Content creators** to write alt text for images, use proper heading styles, make documents accessible, and add captions to videos
   - **Designers** to ensure color contrast meets requirements
   - **Procurement** to include accessibility in contracts for third-party tools
   - **Web developers** to implement technical accessibility standards
   - **Leadership** to allocate time and resources

4. **The cost of waiting is high** — Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically **3-10 times more expensive** than building accessibility in from the start. Organizations are trying to prevent costly retrofitting by addressing accessibility early.

5. **Legal risk is real** — Non-compliance has legal consequences. With specific standards and deadlines, enforcement becomes straightforward. Agencies that don't comply face legal risk, and the Department of Justice has clear criteria to evaluate compliance.

6. **The digital transformation accelerated** — Government services have moved online rapidly, especially since 2020. What used to be in-person services are now digital, making digital accessibility essential for equal access to government services.

7. **The population affected is significant** — According to the CDC, approximately **1 in 4 adults in the United States** has some type of disability. In Illinois, that's over 2.3 million people. When digital content isn't accessible, agencies exclude millions of residents from accessing information and services.

**Why different teams are bringing it up:**

- **Web developers** — They're responsible for implementing technical requirements and need accessible content from others
- **Leadership and compliance** — They're concerned about meeting legal requirements and deadlines
- **Content creators** — They're learning new skills and processes to make their content accessible
- **Procurement** — They need to include accessibility requirements in contracts

**For managers: Understanding vs. delaying**

It's completely understandable that managers want to clarify what digital accessibility entails and get a better sense of the scope, timeline, and resources needed. **However, managers cannot tell the agency to wait on this work.** The deadline is **April 24, 2026** — it's a legal requirement, not a suggestion.

**What managers can do:**

- **Ask questions** — Understand what accessibility means for your team's work
- **Clarify scope** — Get a clear picture of what needs to be done
- **Plan resources** — Allocate time and budget needed for compliance
- **Prioritize work** — Determine what needs to be done first

**What managers cannot do:**

- **Delay the work** — The deadline is firm and cannot be extended
- **Treat it as optional** — It's a legal requirement, not a "nice to have"
- **Push it to "later"** — Waiting makes the work more expensive and increases legal risk

**The reality:** While it's reasonable to want more information before committing resources, the April 2026 deadline is non-negotiable. The best approach is to **learn while doing** — start the work now, ask questions along the way, and adjust plans as you gain more understanding. Waiting until you fully understand everything will only make compliance harder to achieve.

**What matters now:**

The countdown timer on this page shows exactly how much time remains until the compliance deadline. Rather than focusing on why we didn't know sooner, the priority now is incorporating accessibility into our workflows within this timeframe. Use the time remaining to:

- Audit existing content
- Prioritize remediation
- Build accessibility into our workflows
- Train staff on accessibility practices

**What's different from before:**

- **Specific standards** — WCAG 2.1 Level AA provides concrete, testable criteria (unlike vague "accessibility" requirements)
- **Firm deadline** — April 2026 isn't a suggestion; it's a legal requirement
- **Comprehensive coverage** — Documents, videos, social media, and third-party tools are all included
- **Clear enforcement** — The Department of Justice has specific criteria to evaluate compliance

**The bottom line:** Digital accessibility has always been the right thing to do, but now it's also a **legal requirement with specific standards and a firm deadline**. The April 2024 rule transformed digital accessibility from an aspirational goal into a concrete, enforceable mandate. That's why agencies are prioritizing this work now — not because accessibility suddenly matters, but because the legal framework, technical standards, and compliance deadlines are now clearly defined. Digital accessibility is being mentioned frequently because it affects everyone in the organization and requires everyone's participation to succeed.

**The good news:** You're learning about this with enough time to take meaningful action. Many organizations are in the same position, and resources are available to help.

### Why does accessibility matter?

Accessibility matters for several reasons:

- **Legal compliance** — Federal and state laws require accessible digital content
- **Equal access** — Approximately 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. have a disability
- **Better user experience** — Accessible design often improves usability for everyone
- **Broader reach** — Accessible content can be used by more people in more situations

### How does digital accessibility and compliance fit into an agency's DEIA mission?

**Digital accessibility is the natural evolution of the "A" in DEIA — and it's now backed by legal requirements that give accessibility commitments real accountability.**

Many state and local government agencies have long been committed to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) principles, and accessibility has always been part of that commitment. What's evolving is how we define and measure accessibility in an increasingly digital world — and the legal standards that now apply to our online presence.

**What's changed:**

The digital transformation of government services means that accessibility must now extend to everything agencies do online. The April 2026 ADA Title II compliance deadline transforms digital accessibility from an aspirational goal into a legal mandate. This isn't a departure from DEIA values — it's their fulfillment.

**How accessibility enhances agency missions:**

Equity is fundamental to public service — ensuring that all residents, regardless of ability, can access government information, services, and resources. When digital content isn't accessible, agencies exclude people with disabilities from:

- **Public information and services** — Reports, data dashboards, publications, and service information that affects communities
- **Grant and funding opportunities** — Organizations serving communities with higher disability rates need equal access to funding opportunities and application processes
- **Public participation** — Policy discussions, public comment opportunities, and civic engagement must be accessible so that people with disabilities can participate in shaping public policy
- **Emergency and critical services** — Accessible information is essential during emergencies and for accessing critical government services

**Why this strengthens DEIA commitments:**

1. **Equity becomes measurable** — WCAG 2.1 AA standards provide concrete, testable criteria for digital equity. Agencies can now objectively assess whether their digital content truly serves everyone.

2. **Inclusion becomes actionable** — Rather than hoping content is inclusive, agencies have specific guidelines for ensuring people with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities can access information.

3. **Accountability is built in** — Legal requirements mean accessibility isn't dependent on budget cycles, competing priorities, or individual champions. It's a baseline expectation.

4. **Everyone benefits** — Accessible design principles (clear language, logical structure, captions, readable fonts) improve the experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.

**The bottom line:** The 2026 deadline doesn't replace values-driven commitments to accessibility — it reinforces them. Agencies now have the legal framework, technical standards, and organizational accountability to ensure their digital presence truly reflects DEIA principles and advances equity in public service.

### What is WCAG?

WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. These are international standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that explain how to make digital content accessible. WCAG is organized around four principles (POUR):

- **Perceivable** — Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive
- **Operable** — Interface components must be operable by all users
- **Understandable** — Information and operation must be understandable
- **Robust** — Content must work with current and future technologies

### What does "WCAG 2.1 Level AA" mean?

WCAG has three conformance levels:

- **Level A** — Minimum accessibility (must meet)
- **Level AA** — Standard accessibility (should meet) ← _Required for Illinois_
- **Level AAA** — Enhanced accessibility (may meet where feasible)

Illinois requires Level AA conformance, which includes all Level A and Level AA success criteria.

### Isn't accessibility just an IT issue? Shouldn't the web team fix all these issues?

**No, accessibility is not just an IT issue.** While web developers and IT staff play crucial roles, achieving and maintaining accessibility requires collaboration across all units within an organization. Accessibility is everyone's responsibility.

**Why accessibility requires organization-wide effort:**

1. **Content creators** — Writers, editors, and content managers must:
   - Write clear, descriptive alt text for images
   - Use proper heading structure in documents
   - Create meaningful link text (not "click here")
   - Ensure color isn't the only way to convey information
   - Add captions to videos or coordinate captioning

2. **Designers** — Graphic designers and UX designers must:
   - Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
   - Design with keyboard navigation in mind
   - Create focus indicators for interactive elements
   - Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning
   - Design forms with proper labels and error messages

3. **Procurement staff** — Purchasing and contract managers must:
   - Include accessibility requirements in RFPs and contracts
   - Request accessibility documentation from vendors
   - Evaluate third-party tools for accessibility before purchase
   - Ensure contract language mandates WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance

4. **Project managers and program staff** — Must:
   - Include accessibility in project timelines and budgets
   - Coordinate accessibility testing throughout development
   - Ensure accessibility is considered from project start, not as an afterthought
   - Verify that deliverables meet accessibility standards before launch

5. **IT and web development teams** — Must:
   - Implement accessible code and markup
   - Test with assistive technologies
   - Fix technical accessibility barriers
   - Maintain accessible infrastructure and platforms

6. **Leadership and management** — Must:
   - Allocate resources for accessibility training and tools
   - Establish accessibility policies and procedures
   - Support organization-wide accessibility initiatives
   - Ensure compliance with legal requirements

**The problem with "IT-only" thinking:**

- **Content issues** — If content creators don't write proper alt text or use heading styles, developers can't fix it retroactively without recreating content
- **Design issues** — If designs don't meet contrast requirements or lack focus indicators, developers may need to redesign rather than just code
- **Procurement issues** — If inaccessible tools are purchased, IT may be unable to make them accessible without vendor support
- **Timeline and cost** — Fixing accessibility issues after development is typically 3-10 times more expensive than building accessibility in from the start

**Best practice:** Adopt a "shift-left" approach — consider accessibility at every stage: planning, design, content creation, development, and procurement. This prevents costly retrofitting and ensures better outcomes.

## ICJIA-Specific Questions

### Why does ICJIA need to worry about digital accessibility? What does the April 2026 deadline mean for us?

**As an Illinois state agency, ICJIA has legal obligations under both state and federal law to ensure our digital content is accessible.** The April 24, 2026 compliance deadline is not optional — it's a legal requirement that applies directly to ICJIA.

**Why this matters for ICJIA specifically:**

1. **We're a state agency** — ICJIA falls under the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (IITAA), which has required accessible digital content since 2008. The current IITAA 2.1 Standards (effective June 2024) require WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

2. **We serve the public** — ICJIA's mission involves providing information, research, and resources to Illinois residents, criminal justice professionals, and the public. Under ADA Title II, all public-facing digital content must be accessible to people with disabilities.

3. **Millions of Illinois residents need accessible digital content** — According to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC data</a>, approximately **1 in 4 adults in the United States** have some type of disability. In Illinois, this represents over 2.3 million people. Common disabilities include mobility limitations, cognitive difficulties, hearing difficulties, and vision impairment. Many of these individuals rely on accessible digital content to access government services and information. When ICJIA's websites or documents aren't accessible, we're potentially excluding millions of Illinoisans from critical criminal justice information and resources.

4. **Federal funding** — ICJIA receives federal grants. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that any organization receiving federal funding ensure their programs and activities are accessible to people with disabilities.

5. **The April 2026 deadline is firm** — The U.S. Department of Justice's ADA Title II web accessibility rule (published April 24, 2024) requires state and local governments with populations of 50,000 or more to achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance by **April 24, 2026**. Illinois has over 12 million residents, so this deadline applies to all state agencies including ICJIA.

**What "compliance" actually means:**

- All public-facing web pages must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- All public-facing documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint) must be accessible
- Videos must have captions; audio must have transcripts
- Third-party tools and embedded content we provide must be accessible
- Social media posts going forward must be accessible

**What happens if we don't comply:**

- The DOJ can investigate and pursue enforcement actions
- Individuals can file complaints or lawsuits
- ICJIA could face legal costs, remediation costs, and reputational harm
- Most importantly, people with disabilities would be unable to access our information and services

**The reality of digital accessibility now:**

Accessibility is no longer just "best practice" — it's the law. The 2026 deadline creates accountability for what has always been the right thing to do. For ICJIA, this means integrating accessibility into every aspect of our digital presence: websites, documents, social media, and any tools we provide to the public.

**The good news:** Many accessibility improvements also benefit everyone — clearer content, better-organized documents, and more usable websites make information easier to find and understand for all users.

**References:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Fact Sheet</a> — Plain language summary of requirements and deadlines

### If this has been a requirement, why hasn't ICJIA been doing this all along?

**Actually, ICJIA's web team has been building accessible websites for years.** The web developers at ICJIA have been incorporating accessibility best practices into our websites across multiple administrations — this isn't new to them.

**What the web team has been doing:**

- Building websites with semantic HTML structure for screen reader compatibility
- Implementing keyboard navigation and focus management
- Using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where needed
- Following color contrast guidelines
- Adding alt text to images on websites
- Structuring content with proper heading hierarchies
- Testing with accessibility tools and screen readers

**But here's what's critical to understand:**

The web team is responsible for **website accessibility** — not **content accessibility**. These are two very different things:

| Area                      | Responsibility                                                          | Who Does This                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Website accessibility** | Code, navigation, structure, forms, interactive features                | Web team                                           |
| **Content accessibility** | Documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint), videos, images, social media | Content creators (COMMS, R&A, FSGU, program staff) |

**Why content accessibility requires a different approach:**

While the compliance standard is the same (WCAG 2.1 Level AA), **the tools, skills, and workflows for content accessibility are completely different** from what the web team uses:

- **Web accessibility** uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, screen reader testing, and web-specific tools like WAVE and axe DevTools
- **Document accessibility** requires Microsoft Office accessibility features, Adobe Acrobat Pro, PDF remediation tools, and document-specific testing like PAC 2024
- **Video accessibility** needs captioning software, transcript creation, and audio description tools
- **Social media accessibility** involves platform-specific alt text features, caption tools, and accessible content practices

The web team can't make your PDFs accessible for you. They can't add alt text to images you upload. They can't caption your videos. These tasks require **content creators** to learn and apply accessibility practices using tools designed for their specific workflows.

**So what's actually new?**

The difference now isn't that accessibility suddenly matters — it's that there's a **firm legal deadline with specific technical standards**. Before the April 2024 ADA Title II rule:

- Accessibility was a best practice, but enforcement was inconsistent
- There were no specific technical standards mandated by federal law for state agencies
- Compliance was measured against general principles rather than testable criteria
- There was no countdown clock creating organizational urgency

**The April 2026 deadline changes the landscape:**

Now there are specific, testable requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) with a firm compliance date. This creates accountability that didn't exist before — and extends beyond websites to include documents, videos, social media, and all public-facing digital content.

**Why this matters for you:**

If you create content — reports, presentations, social media posts, videos, PDFs, or any public-facing documents — **you** are responsible for making that content accessible. The web team can share what they know about accessibility principles, but the actual work of making content accessible falls to the people creating that content: Communications, Research & Analysis, FSGU, and other units that publish materials.

**The bottom line:** ICJIA's web team has been doing website accessibility for years. What's new is the deadline that now applies to **all content creators**. The compliance standard is the same, but the tools and skills needed for document, video, and social media accessibility are different from web development — and that work belongs to the people creating the content.

| Area                      | Responsibility                                                          | Who Does This                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Website accessibility** | Code, navigation, structure, forms, interactive features                | Web team                                           |
| **Content accessibility** | Documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint), videos, images, social media | Content creators (COMMS, R&A, FSGU, program staff) |

**Why content accessibility requires a different approach:**

While the compliance standard is the same (WCAG 2.1 Level AA), **the tools, skills, and workflows for content accessibility are completely different** from what the web team uses:

- **Web accessibility** uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, screen reader testing, and web-specific tools like WAVE and axe DevTools
- **Document accessibility** requires Microsoft Office accessibility features, Adobe Acrobat Pro, PDF remediation tools, and document-specific testing like PAC 2024
- **Video accessibility** needs captioning software, transcript creation, and audio description tools
- **Social media accessibility** involves platform-specific alt text features, caption tools, and accessible content practices

The web team can't make your PDFs accessible for you. They can't add alt text to images you upload. They can't caption your videos. These tasks require **content creators** to learn and apply accessibility practices using tools designed for their specific workflows.

**So what's actually new?**

The difference now isn't that accessibility suddenly matters — it's that there's a **firm legal deadline with specific technical standards**. Before the April 2024 ADA Title II rule:

- Accessibility was a best practice, but enforcement was inconsistent
- There were no specific technical standards mandated by federal law for state agencies
- Compliance was measured against general principles rather than testable criteria
- There was no countdown clock creating organizational urgency

**The April 2026 deadline changes the landscape:**

Now there are specific, testable requirements (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) with a firm compliance date. This creates accountability that didn't exist before — and extends beyond websites to include documents, videos, social media, and all public-facing digital content.

**Why this matters for you:**

If you create content — reports, presentations, social media posts, videos, PDFs, or any public-facing documents — **you** are responsible for making that content accessible. The web team can share what they know about accessibility principles, but the actual work of making content accessible falls to the people creating that content: Communications, Research & Analysis, FSGU, and other units that publish materials.

**The bottom line:** ICJIA's web team has been doing website accessibility for years. What's new is the deadline that now applies to **all content creators**. The compliance standard is the same, but the tools and skills needed for document, video, and social media accessibility are different from web development — and that work belongs to the people creating the content.

### What happens after April 24, 2026?

**After April 24, 2026, state and local governments must be in compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for all public-facing digital content.** Agencies that fail to meet this deadline may face several potential issues:

**Legal and enforcement consequences:**

- **Department of Justice investigations** — The DOJ can investigate complaints and pursue enforcement actions against non-compliant agencies
- **Complaints and lawsuits** — Individuals with disabilities can file complaints with the DOJ or pursue private lawsuits under the ADA
- **Legal costs and remediation expenses** — Agencies may face significant costs for legal defense, settlements, and emergency remediation of inaccessible content
- **Reputational harm** — Public awareness of accessibility failures can damage an agency's reputation and public trust

**Operational impacts:**

- **Service disruptions** — If complaints or lawsuits result in court orders, agencies may need to temporarily remove or restrict access to non-compliant content
- **Resource reallocation** — Emergency remediation efforts can divert staff time and budget from other priorities
- **Delayed projects** — New digital projects may be delayed while existing accessibility issues are addressed
- **Increased scrutiny** — Agencies with known accessibility issues may face increased oversight and reporting requirements

**What's covered by the deadline:**

The April 2026 deadline applies to all public-facing digital content, not just websites:

- **Websites** — All public-facing web pages, including forms, interactive features, and embedded content
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations published online or shared digitally
- **Mobile apps** — Any mobile applications provided to the public
- **Videos and multimedia** — All video content requires captions; audio content requires transcripts
- **Social media** — Posts, images, and videos shared on social platforms (going forward)
- **Third-party content** — Embedded maps, dashboards, widgets, and tools provided through contracts or agreements
- **Email communications** — Newsletters and other digital communications sent to the public

**The bottom line:** If it's digital and public-facing, it needs to be accessible by April 24, 2026. Agencies that start working toward compliance now have time to address issues systematically. Those that delay may face costly emergency remediation and legal consequences.

### I'm a content creator. Where do I start?

**As a content creator, your role is crucial — you're often the first person to make content accessible (or inaccessible).** Start with these foundational practices that apply to everything you create:

**1. Learn the basics (about 30 minutes):**

- **Alt text for images** — Every image needs descriptive alt text. Learn when to describe what's in the image vs. when to mark it as decorative: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Alternative Text</a>
- **Heading structure** — Use proper heading levels (H1, H2, H3) instead of just making text big and bold. This helps screen reader users navigate: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C: Headings</a>
- **Meaningful link text** — Write links that make sense out of context (not "click here" or "read more"): <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Links and Hypertext</a>
- **Color contrast** — Ensure text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds (4.5:1 for normal text): <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Contrast Checker</a>

**2. Document-specific resources:**

- **Word documents** — <a href="https://www.section508.gov/create/documents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section508.gov: Accessible Word Documents</a>
- **PDFs** — <a href="https://www.section508.gov/create/pdfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section508.gov: Accessible PDFs</a>
- **PowerPoint** — <a href="https://www.section508.gov/create/presentations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section508.gov: Accessible Presentations</a>
- **Excel** — <a href="https://www.section508.gov/create/documents/excel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Section508.gov: Accessible Excel Documents</a>

**3. Video and multimedia:**

- **Captions** — All videos need captions: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C: Captions</a>
- **Transcripts** — Audio content needs transcripts: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/transcripts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C: Transcripts</a>

**4. Quick reference tools:**

**The key mindset shift:** Think about how someone using a screen reader or keyboard navigation would experience your content. If they can't see images, colors, or mouse interactions, can they still understand and use your content? If not, you need to provide alternatives.

### I'm a web developer. Where do I start?

**As a developer, you're building the foundation that makes everything else possible.** Start with these technical practices and tools:

**1. Learn WCAG 2.1 Level AA (the technical standards):**

- **Keyboard navigation** — Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Keyboard Accessibility</a>
- **ARIA when needed** — Use ARIA attributes correctly (but prefer semantic HTML first): <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C ARIA Authoring Practices Guide</a>
- **Focus management** — Visible focus indicators and logical tab order: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WCAG: Focus Visible</a>
- **Form accessibility** — Proper labels, error messages, and validation: <a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Forms</a>

**3. Testing tools (integrate into your workflow):**

- **Angular** — <a href="https://angular.io/guide/accessibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular Accessibility Guide</a>

**5. Automated testing integration:**

- **axe-core** — <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open-source accessibility testing engine</a> (works with Jest, Cypress, Playwright, etc.)
- **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y** — <a href="https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESLint plugin for accessibility</a>

**6. Training and deeper learning:**

- **Illinois DoIT Training** — <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/training.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Request web development accessibility training</a>

**7. Code review checklist:**

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation works throughout
- Focus indicators are visible
- Color contrast meets 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text)
- Images have alt text (or are marked decorative)
- Forms have proper labels and error messages
- ARIA is used correctly (or semantic HTML is preferred)
- Automated tests pass (axe-core, WAVE, Lighthouse)

**The key mindset:** Build accessibility in from the start, not as an afterthought. It's much easier and cheaper than retrofitting later. Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers regularly, not just at the end.

### I'm a manager. Where do I start?

**As a manager, your role is to create the organizational conditions for accessibility success.** You don't need to become a technical expert, but you do need to understand the requirements, allocate resources, and support your team. Start here:

**1. Understand the legal requirements and timeline:**

- **The deadline is firm** — April 24, 2026 for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- **It applies to everything** — Websites, documents, videos, social media, mobile apps
- **It's not optional** — This is a legal requirement under ADA Title II and IITAA
- **Read the basics** — <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule Fact Sheet</a> — Plain language summary of requirements

**2. Assess your current state:**

- **Audit existing content** — Identify all public-facing digital content (websites, documents, videos, social media)
- **Prioritize by impact** — Focus on high-traffic pages, frequently accessed documents, and critical services first
- **Identify gaps** — Use automated tools and manual testing to find accessibility issues
- **Estimate remediation effort** — Understand the scope of work needed

**3. Build accessibility into your processes:**

- **Include accessibility in project timelines** — Don't treat it as an add-on; build it into initial project plans
- **Require accessibility in procurement** — Include WCAG 2.1 AA requirements in RFPs and vendor contracts
- **Establish content review processes** — Ensure documents and content are checked for accessibility before publication
- **Create accessibility checkpoints** — Build accessibility reviews into your content approval workflows

**4. Allocate resources strategically:**

- **Training budget** — Invest in accessibility training for content creators, developers, and designers
- **Tools and software** — Provide accessibility testing tools (WAVE, axe DevTools, PDF accessibility checkers)
- **Time allocation** — Recognize that creating accessible content may take slightly longer initially
- **Expert support** — Consider accessibility consultants or specialists for complex projects

**5. Support your team:**

- **Make it a priority** — Communicate that accessibility is important and expected
- **Remove barriers** — Ensure staff have access to training, tools, and time needed
- **Celebrate progress** — Recognize teams and individuals who successfully implement accessibility
- **Learn alongside your team** — Attend training sessions to understand what your team is learning

**6. Establish accountability:**

- **Assign responsibilities** — Clearly define who is responsible for accessibility in each area
- **Set expectations** — Make accessibility part of job descriptions and performance expectations
- **Track progress** — Monitor compliance status and remediation efforts
- **Regular check-ins** — Include accessibility in regular team meetings and project reviews

**7. Connect with resources:**

- **Illinois DoIT** — <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact DoIT.Accessibility@Illinois.gov</a> for training, guidance, and support
- **Accessibility coordinators** — Identify or designate an accessibility coordinator in your organization
- **Peer networks** — Connect with other managers facing similar challenges
- **Legal/compliance team** — Work with your legal or compliance office to understand requirements

**8. Plan for the long term:**

- **Sustainability** — Build accessibility into ongoing operations, not just a one-time project
- **Continuous improvement** — Accessibility is an ongoing commitment, not a one-time fix
- **Stay informed** — Keep up with accessibility standards and best practices
- **Documentation** — Maintain records of accessibility efforts and compliance status

**Key management principles:**

- **Start early** — The earlier you begin, the easier and cheaper it is
- **It's everyone's responsibility** — Not just IT; content creators, designers, and project managers all play roles
- **Prevention is cheaper than remediation** — Building accessibility in from the start costs 3-10 times less than fixing later
- **Accessibility benefits everyone** — Accessible design improves usability for all users, not just those with disabilities

**The bottom line:** As a manager, you don't need to become a technical expert, but you do need to create the organizational support, resources, and accountability that enable your team to succeed. The April 2026 deadline is firm, but with proper planning and support, your organization can achieve compliance.

## ADA Title II Web Rule

### What is the ADA Title II web accessibility rule?

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice published a final rule establishing specific technical requirements for web content and mobile app accessibility under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rule requires state and local governments to make their public-facing digital content meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Official fact sheet:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>

### How does Title II differ from Title I? I'm familiar with Title I, but Title II is new to me.

**Title I and Title II are two different parts of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) that cover different areas of disability rights.** Understanding the difference helps clarify why the April 2026 deadline is significant and how it relates to what you may already know about ADA compliance.

**ADA Title I — Employment (What you're likely familiar with):**

Title I of the ADA prohibits employment discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities. It applies to:

- **Private employers** with 15 or more employees
- **State and local governments** (regardless of size)
- **Employment agencies**
- **Labor organizations**

**Key aspects of Title I:**

- **Reasonable accommodations** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees with disabilities unless doing so would cause "undue hardship"
- **Non-discrimination** — Employers cannot discriminate in hiring, firing, promotions, pay, or other employment practices
- **Interactive process** — Employers and employees work together to determine appropriate accommodations
- **Case-by-case basis** — Accommodations are determined individually based on the employee's needs and job requirements
- **No specific technical standards** — Title I doesn't mandate specific technical standards like WCAG; it focuses on providing reasonable accommodations

**Examples of Title I accommodations:**

- Providing screen reader software for an employee with vision impairment
- Modifying work schedules for medical appointments
- Providing ergonomic equipment or modified workstations
- Making internal documents accessible when an employee needs them to perform their job

**ADA Title II — Public Services (What's new with the 2026 deadline):**

Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in all programs, services, and activities provided by state and local governments. The April 2024 web accessibility rule adds specific technical requirements for digital content.

**Key aspects of Title II:**

- **Applies to state and local governments** — All public entities, regardless of size
- **Covers public-facing services** — Programs, services, and activities provided to the public
- **Specific technical standards** — The 2024 rule requires WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (unlike Title I, which has no specific technical standards)
- **Proactive compliance** — Must make content accessible before someone requests it (unlike Title I's case-by-case accommodation approach)
- **Firm deadline** — April 24, 2026 for entities with populations of 50,000 or more
- **Covers digital content** — Websites, mobile apps, documents, videos, social media, and all public-facing digital content

**Examples of Title II requirements:**

- Making all public-facing websites WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Ensuring PDFs, Word documents, and Excel files are accessible
- Providing captions for videos
- Making online forms and applications accessible
- Ensuring social media posts are accessible (going forward)

**Key Differences Between Title I and Title II:**

| Aspect                  | Title I (Employment)                                          | Title II (Public Services)                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Who it applies to**   | Employers (private and public)                                | State and local governments                    |
| **What it covers**      | Employment practices and workplace accommodations             | Public programs, services, and activities      |
| **Approach**            | Case-by-case reasonable accommodations                        | Proactive accessibility for all public content |
| **Technical standards** | No specific standards; accommodations determined individually | WCAG 2.1 Level AA required                     |
| **Timeline**            | Accommodations provided when requested                        | Must be compliant by April 2026 deadline       |
| **Scope**               | Individual employee needs                                     | All public-facing digital content              |
| **Internal vs. public** | Primarily internal (workplace)                                | Primarily public-facing content                |

**Why Title II might feel "new":**

1. **The web rule is recent** — While Title II has existed since 1990, the specific web accessibility rule with technical standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) was only published in April 2024. This is the first time the Department of Justice has established specific technical requirements for digital accessibility under Title II.

2. **Different enforcement history** — Title I has been actively enforced through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for decades, with many employers familiar with the reasonable accommodation process. Title II web accessibility enforcement has been less consistent until now.

3. **Different focus** — Title I focuses on individual accommodations in the workplace, while Title II focuses on ensuring public services are accessible to everyone. The web rule extends this to digital content, which is a newer area of focus.

**How Title I and Title II relate to each other:**

- **They can overlap** — For example, if a state agency employee with a disability needs to access internal documents to do their job, Title I (reasonable accommodation) may require making those documents accessible. If those same documents are also public-facing, Title II would also require them to be accessible.

- **Different requirements** — Title I requires reasonable accommodations for employees; Title II requires proactive accessibility for public content. An agency might need to comply with both.

- **Complementary protections** — Both titles work together to ensure people with disabilities have equal access — Title I in employment, Title II in public services.

**For ICJIA specifically:**

- **Title I** applies to ICJIA as an employer — we must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities
- **Title II** applies to ICJIA as a state agency — we must make all public-facing digital content accessible by April 2026
- **Both apply** — ICJIA must comply with both Title I (for employees) and Title II (for public services)

**The bottom line:** Title I is about employment accommodations (what you're familiar with), while Title II is about making public services accessible to everyone (what the 2026 deadline addresses). The April 2024 web rule is the first time Title II has had specific technical standards for digital content, which is why it may feel new even though Title II itself has existed since 1990.

### When must we comply with the ADA Title II rule?

| Entity Size                  | Compliance Deadline |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Population of 50,000 or more | **April 24, 2026**  |
| Population less than 50,000  | April 26, 2027      |

For most Illinois state agencies, the deadline is **April 24, 2026**.

### Does ADA Title II apply to internal documents?

**No, the ADA Title II web rule does not directly apply to purely internal content.** The rule specifically covers "services, programs, and activities provided or made available" to the public.

**However**, internal content may still need to be accessible under:

- **ADA Title I** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, which could include making internal systems accessible
- **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities
- **IITAA** — Illinois law covers intranets and internal systems used by state employees

**Best practice:** Make internal documents accessible proactively. It's easier than retrofitting later, and you may have employees with disabilities who need access.

### What content is covered by the ADA Title II rule?

The rule covers all web content and mobile apps that state and local governments provide or make available to the public, including:

- Websites and web applications
- Mobile apps
- Online documents (PDFs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Online forms and applications

### What about third-party widgets and embedded content?

You are responsible for the accessibility of third-party content that you embed or integrate into your website through contracts or agreements. This includes:

- Payment processors
- Scheduling tools
- Chat widgets
- Embedded maps
- Social media feeds
- Survey tools

**Best practice:** Request accessibility documentation from vendors before purchasing, and include accessibility requirements in contracts.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a> (see section on "Third-Party Content Provided Through Contracts or Agreements")

### Do embedded dashboards and maps (like Tableau or ArcGIS) need to be accessible?

**Yes, embedded dashboards and maps must be accessible to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements for ADA Title II compliance.** Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, you are responsible for ensuring that all third-party content you embed or integrate into your website is accessible, including data visualization tools like Tableau, mapping services like ArcGIS, and other embedded interactive content.

**Key requirements for embedded content:**

1. **Keyboard accessibility** — All interactive elements (filters, buttons, zoom controls, data points) must be operable using only a keyboard, without requiring mouse interaction.

2. **Screen reader compatibility** — Content must be readable by screen readers, with proper labels, descriptions, and alternative text for visual elements.

3. **Color contrast** — Text and interactive elements must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components).

4. **Alternative formats** — Provide accessible alternatives when embedded content cannot be made fully accessible:
   - Data tables or CSV exports for dashboards
   - Text descriptions or alternative map formats for geographic information
   - Static images with detailed alt text when interactive features aren't accessible

5. **Focus indicators** — Visible focus indicators must be present for keyboard navigation.

**What to do before embedding:**

- **Request accessibility documentation** — Ask vendors for accessibility conformance reports or documentation that specifically address WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

- **Test with assistive technology** — Test embedded content with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation before going live.

- **Include accessibility in contracts** — Specify WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements in procurement contracts and service agreements.

- **Provide alternatives** — If embedded content cannot be made fully accessible, provide equivalent accessible alternatives (e.g., downloadable data files, alternative map formats, or text descriptions).

**Vendor-specific considerations:**

- **Tableau** — Tableau has made accessibility improvements, but embedded dashboards may require configuration for full accessibility. Test thoroughly and provide data exports as alternatives.

- **ArcGIS** — ArcGIS Online and embedded maps have accessibility features, but complex interactive maps may need alternative formats. Consider providing static map images with detailed descriptions or alternative navigation methods.

**Remember:** Simply embedding third-party content does not absolve you of accessibility responsibility. If you cannot make embedded content accessible, you must provide accessible alternatives that offer equivalent functionality and information.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Third-Party Content</a> (see section on "Third-Party Content Provided Through Contracts or Agreements")

### Does our agency's password-protected intranet site need to be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant? What about documents on the intranet?

**Short answer:** Password-protected intranet sites that are **only accessible to agency employees** (not the public) are generally **exempt from the ADA Title II web rule**, but they may still need to be accessible under other laws and best practices.

**ADA Title II exemption:**

The ADA Title II web rule specifically covers content "provided or made available to the public." Password-protected intranet sites that are:

- Only accessible to agency employees
- Not accessible to the general public
- Protected by authentication (login required)

...are generally **exempt from ADA Title II WCAG 2.1 AA requirements**.

**However, other legal requirements may still apply:**

1. **IITAA (Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act)** — Illinois state law requires that intranets and internal systems used by state employees be accessible. IITAA applies to:
   - State agency intranets
   - Internal web applications
   - Internal systems used by employees
   - Documents and content on internal systems

2. **ADA Title I (Employment)** — Employers must provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities. If an employee with a disability needs access to an intranet site or internal documents to perform their job, the employer may be required to make that content accessible as a reasonable accommodation.

3. **Section 504** — Organizations receiving federal funding must ensure programs are accessible to employees with disabilities, which can include internal systems.

**What this means for your intranet:**

- **The intranet site itself** — Should be accessible under IITAA and as a reasonable accommodation under ADA Title I
- **Documents on the intranet** — Should be accessible, especially if they're:
  - Required for employees to do their jobs
  - Used for training or professional development
  - Shared with employees who may have disabilities
  - Part of employee services (benefits, HR, etc.)

**What about archived documents on the intranet?**

**Archived documents (PDFs, Excel, Word, etc.) that are truly archived and not currently used:**

- **Generally exempt** — If documents are archived (not actively used, historical records, replaced by newer versions), they may be exempt from accessibility requirements
- **However**, you must still provide accessible alternatives **upon request** if an employee with a disability needs access to archived content
- **Best practice:** Even archived documents should be made accessible if they're:
  - Referenced or linked from active intranet pages
  - Part of a document library that employees might search
  - Needed for reference or historical context

**After the compliance deadline (April 24, 2026), do all documents need to be accessible?**

**For new documents created after the deadline:**

- **Yes** — All new documents (PDFs, Excel, Word, PowerPoint, etc.) posted to the intranet after the deadline should be accessible
- This includes documents created internally or received from external sources
- Make accessibility part of your document creation workflow

**For existing documents created before the deadline:**

- **Prioritize by usage** — Focus on making accessible:
  - Documents that are actively used by employees
  - Documents required for job functions
  - Frequently accessed documents
  - Documents linked from main intranet pages
- **Archived documents** — May remain as-is unless an employee requests access, at which point you must provide an accessible version

**Key principle:** The requirement is to ensure employees with disabilities can access the information they need to do their jobs. If a document is truly archived and never accessed, it may not need immediate remediation. But if any employee needs it, you must provide an accessible version.

**Best practices:**

1. **Make the intranet accessible** — Even if technically exempt from ADA Title II, making your intranet WCAG 2.1 AA compliant:
   - Ensures compliance with IITAA
   - Supports employees with disabilities
   - Prevents the need for retrofitting if content later becomes public-facing
   - Improves usability for all employees

2. **Prioritize critical content** — Focus on making accessible:
   - Employee-facing services (benefits, HR systems, time tracking)
   - Required training materials
   - Frequently accessed documents
   - Forms and applications employees must use
   - New documents created after the compliance deadline

3. **Create an accessibility workflow** — Establish processes to:
   - Make all new documents accessible before posting to the intranet
   - Remediate existing documents based on usage and priority
   - Respond promptly to requests for accessible versions of archived documents

4. **Test with employees** — If you have employees who use assistive technologies, involve them in testing your intranet

5. **Document accessibility efforts** — Keep records of:
   - Which documents are accessible vs. need remediation
   - Accessibility features implemented
   - Any accommodations provided
   - Requests for accessible versions of archived documents

**Resources:**

- **IITAA Requirements:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa.html</a>
- **ADA Title I (Employment):** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/topics/ada-employment/</a>

**The bottom line:** While password-protected intranet sites are generally exempt from ADA Title II public-facing requirements, they should still be made accessible to comply with IITAA, support employees with disabilities, and avoid the need for accommodations on a case-by-case basis. **All new documents posted after the compliance deadline should be accessible.** For existing documents, prioritize by usage and ensure you can provide accessible versions upon request. Make your intranet and internal documents accessible — it's the right thing to do and helps ensure all employees can access the tools they need to do their jobs.

### How do I test third-party tool compliance? What do I do to verify (for example, Docebo or DocuSign) compliance?

**Testing third-party tools for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requires a multi-step approach.** You can't rely solely on vendor claims — you need to verify accessibility yourself. Here's how to test tools like Docebo, DocuSign, or other third-party platforms:

**1. Request accessibility documentation:**

- **VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)** — Request the most recent VPAT from the vendor
- **Accessibility conformance report** — Ask for documentation that specifically addresses WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- **Accessibility roadmap** — If the tool isn't fully compliant, ask about plans to address gaps
- **Version information** — Ensure documentation matches the version you're using or planning to use

**What to look for in documentation:**

- "Supports" (not just "Partially Supports") for WCAG 2.1 Level AA criteria
- Specific features that are accessible vs. those with limitations
- Known accessibility barriers and workarounds
- Testing methods used by the vendor

**2. Automated accessibility testing:**

- **Use browser extensions:**
  - **WAVE** — <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wave.webaim.org/</a> (free browser extension)
  - **axe DevTools** — <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.deque.com/axe/</a> (free browser extension)
  - **ANDI** — <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html</a> (free browser extension)

- **Test key workflows:**
  - Log in/authentication process
  - Primary user tasks (e.g., signing documents in DocuSign, taking courses in Docebo)
  - Navigation and menus
  - Forms and data entry
  - Error messages and feedback
  - Help documentation

**3. Manual keyboard testing:**

- **Navigate the entire interface using only the keyboard:**
  - Tab through all interactive elements
  - Use Enter/Space to activate buttons and links
  - Use arrow keys for menus and dropdowns
  - Ensure all functionality is accessible without a mouse

- **Check for keyboard traps:**
  - Can you navigate away from all elements?
  - Are there any areas where keyboard focus gets stuck?
  - Can you complete all tasks using only the keyboard?

**4. Screen reader testing:**

- **Test with at least one screen reader:**
  - **NVDA** (Windows, free) — <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.nvaccess.org/</a>
  - **JAWS** (Windows, paid) — Industry standard
  - **VoiceOver** (Mac/iOS, built-in) — Free, built into Apple devices

- **What to test:**
  - Can you understand the page structure and content?
  - Are form fields properly labeled?
  - Are buttons and links clearly identified?
  - Are error messages announced?
  - Is the reading order logical?
  - Can you complete all tasks using the screen reader?

**5. Visual accessibility testing:**

- **Color contrast:**
  - Use WebAIM Contrast Checker — <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>
  - Test text against backgrounds (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
  - Test interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields)

- **Color dependency:**
  - Can you understand all information without relying on color?
  - Are there icons, text labels, or patterns in addition to color?
  - Test in grayscale or with color blindness simulators

- **Text size and readability:**
  - Can text be resized up to 200% without loss of functionality?
  - Is text readable at standard sizes (minimum 12pt, preferably 14pt+)?
  - Is there adequate line spacing?

**6. Test with real users (if possible):**

- **User testing with people with disabilities:**
  - Recruit testers who use assistive technologies
  - Have them complete typical tasks in the tool
  - Document barriers and issues they encounter
  - This provides the most accurate assessment of real-world accessibility

**7. Document your findings:**

- **Create a testing report:**
  - List all features tested
  - Document accessibility barriers found
  - Note which WCAG criteria are met vs. not met
  - Include screenshots or video recordings of issues
  - Compare findings with vendor's VPAT

- **Track compliance status:**
  - Maintain records of testing dates and results
  - Update documentation as tools are updated
  - Share findings with procurement and IT teams

**8. For specific tools (Docebo, DocuSign):**

**Testing Docebo:**

- Test course navigation and completion
- Verify video captions work correctly
- Test quiz and assessment accessibility
- Check document upload and viewing
- Test mobile app accessibility (if used)

**Testing DocuSign:**

- Test the document signing workflow end-to-end
- Verify document viewing and navigation
- Test form field completion
- Check error handling and messages
- Test on both web and mobile platforms

**9. Ongoing monitoring:**

- **Regular re-testing:**
  - Test again when tools are updated
  - Re-test after customizations or branding changes
  - Monitor for new accessibility barriers

- **User feedback:**
  - Track accessibility complaints or requests
  - Document workarounds needed for accessibility barriers
  - Report issues to vendors and request fixes

**Resources for testing:**

- **DoIT Testing Resources:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/testing.html</a>
- **Section 508 ICT Testing Baseline:** <a href="https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/</a>
- **W3C Easy Checks:** <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/</a>
- **WebAIM Testing Guide:** <a href="https://webaim.org/articles/testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webaim.org/articles/testing/</a>

**The bottom line:** Testing third-party tool compliance requires both automated tools and manual testing with assistive technologies. Don't rely solely on vendor claims — verify accessibility yourself through systematic testing. Document your findings, compare them with vendor documentation, and maintain ongoing monitoring as tools are updated.

### Our agency uses DocuSign to digitally sign documents. Is this something that falls under WCAG compliance?

**Yes, DocuSign falls under WCAG compliance requirements.** As a web-based application used by state agencies to provide services to the public, DocuSign must meet accessibility standards under both ADA Title II and IITAA.

**DocuSign platform accessibility:**

DocuSign has made efforts to improve accessibility and provides some accessibility features, but **the platform may not be fully WCAG 2.1 AA compliant in all areas**. Key considerations:

- **Platform accessibility** — DocuSign's web interface and mobile apps should be accessible, but you should verify current compliance status
- **Document accessibility** — The documents you send through DocuSign must be accessible (see [How do I make a PDF accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-pdf-accessible) and [How do I make a Word document accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-word-document-accessible) above)
- **User experience** — Even if the platform is accessible, the signing process must be usable by people with disabilities

**What you need to do:**

1. **Ensure documents are accessible before sending:**
   - Make PDFs, Word documents, or other files accessible **before** uploading them to DocuSign
   - Use accessible document formats (see [How do I make a PDF accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-pdf-accessible) and [How do I make a Word document accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-word-document-accessible) above)
   - Run accessibility checkers on documents before sending them through DocuSign

2. **Request accessibility documentation from DocuSign:**
   - Ask your DocuSign account representative for their current accessibility conformance report (VPAT - Voluntary Product Accessibility Template)
   - Request documentation of WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Verify which features are accessible and which may have limitations

3. **Test the signing process:**
   - Test DocuSign workflows with keyboard-only navigation
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver)
   - Verify that all signing steps are accessible
   - Ensure error messages are accessible and clear

4. **Provide alternatives if needed:**
   - If DocuSign has accessibility barriers, provide alternative methods for people with disabilities to sign documents
   - This might include:
     - Accessible PDF forms that can be signed and returned via email
     - In-person signing options
     - Phone-based signing processes
     - Other accessible electronic signature solutions

5. **Train staff on accessible use:**
   - Ensure staff know how to create accessible documents for DocuSign
   - Train staff on DocuSign's accessibility features
   - Provide guidance on handling accessibility requests from signers

**Best practices for using DocuSign accessibly:**

- **Start with accessible source documents** — Don't rely on DocuSign to make inaccessible documents accessible
- **Use clear instructions** — Provide clear, accessible instructions for signers on how to complete the signing process
- **Test your workflows** — Test the entire signing workflow with assistive technologies before sending to users
- **Monitor for issues** — Track any accessibility complaints or barriers reported by users
- **Have a backup plan** — Know how to provide alternative signing methods if DocuSign is inaccessible for a particular user

**Legal considerations:**

Under ADA Title II and IITAA, state agencies must:

- Ensure that services provided through third-party platforms are accessible
- Provide accessible alternatives if a platform has accessibility barriers
- Not rely solely on a vendor's claims — agencies are responsible for ensuring accessibility

**Resources:**

- **DocuSign Accessibility:** Check DocuSign's current accessibility documentation and VPAT
- **DoIT Procurement Guidance:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility/iitaa/iitaa-procurement.html</a>
- **Section 508 ICT Testing:** <a href="https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.section508.gov/test/ict-testing/</a>

**The bottom line:** DocuSign is subject to WCAG compliance requirements. Your agency is responsible for ensuring that documents sent through DocuSign are accessible and that the signing process is usable by people with disabilities. Start with accessible source documents, verify DocuSign's current accessibility status, test your workflows, and have alternative methods available if needed.

### Is a Learning Management System (LMS) like Docebo WCAG 2.1 compliant?

**LMS platform accessibility:**

Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Docebo, Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, and others have made efforts to improve accessibility, but **the platforms themselves may not be fully WCAG 2.1 AA compliant out of the box**. Platform accessibility depends on:

- **Platform version and configuration** — Newer versions typically have better accessibility features
- **Custom branding and themes** — Custom styling can introduce accessibility barriers
- **Third-party integrations** — Plugins, add-ons, and integrations may not be accessible
- **Platform-specific features** — Some LMS features may have accessibility limitations

**Important:** Even if an LMS platform has accessibility features, **course content you create must still be designed accessibly**. The platform can't make inaccessible content accessible.

**What to do when designing accessible LMS courses (using Docebo as an example):**

1. **Use accessible document formats for course materials:**
   - Upload accessible Word documents, PDFs, and PowerPoint presentations (see [How do I make a Word document accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-word-document-accessible), [How do I make a PDF accessible?](#how-do-i-make-a-pdf-accessible), and [How do I make PowerPoint presentations accessible?](#how-do-i-make-powerpoint-presentations-accessible) in the Content Accessibility section)
   - Ensure all uploaded documents meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards before uploading

2. **Video content:**
   - **Add captions** — Most LMS platforms (including Docebo) support captions; upload accurate caption files (SRT or VTT format)
   - **Review auto-generated captions** — If using auto-captioning features, review and correct errors
   - **Provide transcripts** — Include downloadable transcripts for all video content
   - **Audio description** — For videos with essential visual information not conveyed in audio, provide audio descriptions

3. **Images and graphics:**
   - **Add alt text** — Use the LMS platform's alt text fields for all images, charts, and graphics
   - **Describe complex images** — For charts, graphs, or infographics, provide detailed descriptions or data tables
   - **Avoid text in images** — Don't put important text only in images; include it as actual text

4. **Course structure and navigation:**
   - **Use clear, descriptive headings** — Structure content with proper heading hierarchy
   - **Meaningful link text** — Use descriptive link text (not "click here" or "read more")
   - **Logical reading order** — Ensure content flows in a logical sequence
   - **Clear navigation** — Use descriptive page titles and module names

5. **Interactive elements:**
   - **Keyboard accessible** — Ensure all interactive elements (quizzes, buttons, links) can be accessed via keyboard
   - **Focus indicators** — Verify that keyboard focus is visible on all interactive elements
   - **Form labels** — Ensure all form fields have clear, associated labels
   - **Error messages** — Provide clear, accessible error messages for quizzes and assessments

6. **Color and contrast:**
   - **Sufficient contrast** — Ensure text has at least 4.5:1 contrast ratio (3:1 for large text)
   - **Don't rely on color alone** — Use icons, text labels, or patterns in addition to color to convey information
   - **Test contrast** — Use tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify contrast ratios

7. **Text content:**
   - **Plain language** — Write in clear, simple language
   - **Readable fonts** — Use readable font sizes (minimum 12pt, preferably 14pt or larger)
   - **Line spacing** — Ensure adequate line spacing for readability
   - **Text formatting** — Use proper heading styles, lists, and formatting (not just visual styling)

8. **Quizzes and assessments:**
   - **Clear instructions** — Provide clear, accessible instructions for all quiz questions
   - **Multiple question types** — Ensure all question types (multiple choice, true/false, etc.) are keyboard accessible
   - **Time limits** — If quizzes have time limits, provide warnings and allow extensions for users who need them
   - **Feedback** — Provide accessible feedback for correct/incorrect answers

9. **Testing your course:**
   - **Test with keyboard only** — Navigate the entire course using only the keyboard (Tab, Enter, Space, arrow keys)
   - **Test with screen reader** — Test with a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver) to ensure content is accessible
   - **Use accessibility checkers** — Run automated accessibility checks on uploaded documents before adding them to the LMS
   - **User testing** — If possible, have users with disabilities test the course and provide feedback

**Best practices for LMS course design:**

- **Start with accessible source materials** — Make documents accessible before uploading to the LMS
- **Use the LMS platform's accessibility features** — Take advantage of alt text fields, caption uploads, and other accessibility options available in your platform
- **Test early and often** — Don't wait until the course is complete to test accessibility
- **Provide alternatives** — For complex interactive content, provide alternative formats or text-based versions
- **Document accessibility** — Keep records of accessibility features you've implemented
- **Check platform-specific documentation** — Review your LMS vendor's accessibility documentation and VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template) if available

**Resources:**

- **LMS Accessibility Documentation:** Check your LMS platform's help documentation for current accessibility features and best practices (e.g., Docebo, Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard)
- **WCAG 2.1 Guidelines:** <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa</a>
- **WebAIM Contrast Checker:** <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>

**The bottom line:** LMS platforms like Docebo provide tools to create accessible courses, but **you are responsible for ensuring your course content meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards**. Start with accessible source materials, use your LMS platform's accessibility features, and test your courses with assistive technologies before publishing.

### If we have existing content like Tableau dashboards, ArcGIS maps, or Docebo online courses, do those fall into the exemption category? Or do they need to be made immediately accessible?

**No exemptions for currently used content.** All third-party content — including Tableau dashboards, ArcGIS maps, Docebo courses, and any other web-based tools — **must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant** to meet ADA Title II guidelines. If these tools are **currently being used to provide services to the public**, they must be made accessible — **no exemptions apply**.

**The key distinction:**

- **Currently used for services** = **Must be accessible** (no exemptions)
- **Archived/not currently used** = May be exempt, but must provide accessible alternatives upon request

**For Tableau dashboards:**

**If the dashboard is currently active and used for public services:**

- **Must be made accessible immediately** — No exemptions
- Tableau dashboards are web-based applications that provide services to the public
- They fall under WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
- You must remediate existing dashboards or provide accessible alternatives

**What to do:**

1. **Audit existing dashboards** — Identify all active Tableau dashboards used for public services
2. **Prioritize by usage** — Start with the most frequently used or critical dashboards
3. **Remediate or replace** — Either make dashboards accessible or provide accessible alternatives (accessible data tables, accessible PDFs, or alternative formats)
4. **Test accessibility** — Verify dashboards work with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and meet color contrast requirements
5. **Provide alternatives** — If a dashboard can't be made fully accessible, provide the same information in an accessible format

**For ArcGIS maps and applications:**

**If the map or application is currently active and used for public services:**

- **Must be made accessible immediately** — No exemptions
- ArcGIS maps and web applications are web-based tools that provide services to the public
- They fall under WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
- You must remediate existing maps/applications or provide accessible alternatives

**What to do:**

1. **Audit existing maps/applications** — Identify all active ArcGIS content used for public services
2. **Prioritize by usage** — Start with the most frequently used or critical maps/applications
3. **Remediate or provide alternatives** — Either make ArcGIS content accessible or provide accessible alternatives (accessible data tables, text descriptions, or alternative formats)
4. **Test accessibility** — Verify maps/applications work with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and meet color contrast requirements
5. **Provide alternatives** — If an ArcGIS map/application can't be made fully accessible, provide the same information in an accessible format (data tables, text descriptions, accessible PDFs)

**For Docebo online courses:**

**If the course is currently active and used for training or services:**

- **Must be made accessible immediately** — No exemptions
- Online courses are web-based content that provides services to the public
- They fall under WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
- You must remediate existing courses or provide accessible alternatives

**What to do:**

1. **Audit existing courses** — Identify all active courses currently in use
2. **Prioritize by enrollment** — Start with courses that have active enrollments or are required for services
3. **Remediate course content** — Make all course materials accessible (see [Is a Learning Management System (LMS) like Docebo WCAG 2.1 compliant?](#is-a-learning-management-system-lms-like-docebo-wcag-21-compliant) question above)
4. **Test with assistive technologies** — Verify courses work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
5. **Provide alternatives** — If a course can't be made fully accessible, provide the same training content in an accessible format

**When exemptions might apply:**

**Only if content is truly archived and not currently used:**

- Dashboards, maps, or courses that are no longer active
- Historical/archived content not used for current services
- Content that has been replaced by newer versions

**Even with exemptions:**

- You must provide accessible alternatives **upon request**
- If someone requests access to archived content, you must make it accessible or provide an accessible alternative

**Important considerations:**

1. **All third-party content must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant** — This includes Tableau dashboards, ArcGIS maps, Docebo courses, and any other web-based tools used to provide services. There are no exceptions for third-party tools — they must meet the same accessibility standards as your agency's own content.

2. **"Currently used" is broadly defined** — If content is accessible to the public or used by staff to provide services, it's considered "currently used"

3. **No grace period for existing content** — The April 2026 deadline applies to all content, including existing dashboards, maps, and courses. All third-party tools must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant to meet ADA Title II guidelines.

4. **Prioritization is allowed** — You can prioritize which dashboards/maps/courses to remediate first, but all active content must eventually be accessible

5. **Documentation matters** — Keep records of:
   - Which dashboards/maps/courses are active vs. archived
   - Remediation plans and timelines
   - Alternative formats provided
   - VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates) from vendors

**Best practices:**

- **Start remediation now** — Don't wait until the deadline
- **Prioritize high-impact content** — Focus on the most-used dashboards, maps, and courses first
- **Plan for alternatives** — Have a plan to provide accessible alternatives if full remediation isn't immediately possible
- **Test early and often** — Test accessibility as you remediate, not just at the end
- **Document everything** — Keep records of remediation efforts and alternative formats
- **Request VPATs from vendors** — Ask third-party tool vendors for their Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates to understand their accessibility status
- **Verify compliance** — Don't assume third-party tools are accessible; test them yourself to ensure they meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

**Resources:**

- **ADA Title II Web Rule:** <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/</a>
- **DoIT Accessibility Guidance:** <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/initiatives/accessibility.html</a>

**The bottom line:** All third-party content — including Tableau dashboards, ArcGIS maps, Docebo courses, and any other web-based tools — **must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant** to meet ADA Title II guidelines. Existing content that is **currently used for public services has no exemptions** — it must be made accessible. Only truly archived content that is not currently used may be exempt, and even then, you must provide accessible alternatives upon request. Start remediation now and prioritize the most critical content first.

## Content Accessibility (Documents, PDFs, Presentations)

### What about photos ICJIA takes at events — like speeches or awards ceremonies? Do those need to be accessible?

**Yes, if you're sharing them digitally.** Any photos published on ICJIA's website, social media, or in digital documents need alt text (alternative text) that describes the image for people who can't see it.

**What is alt text?**

Alt text is a brief written description of an image that screen readers read aloud to users who are blind or have low vision. It's also displayed if an image fails to load.

**How to write good alt text for event photos:**

- **Be specific and concise** — Describe what's actually happening in the photo
- **Include relevant names** — If someone is being recognized, name them
- **Describe the context** — What event is this? What's the setting?
- **Keep it brief** — Usually 1-2 sentences is sufficient

**Examples:**

| Photo Type     | Poor Alt Text             | Good Alt Text                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Award ceremony | "Photo" or "IMG_4523.jpg" | "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe at the annual ICJIA awards ceremony" |
| Speech         | "Person speaking"         | "ICJIA Executive Director addresses attendees at the 2025 Victim Services Conference"                            |
| Group photo    | "Group of people"         | "ICJIA Research & Analysis Unit staff at the December 2025 all-hands meeting"                                    |
| Event venue    | "Conference room"         | "Attendees networking during a break at the Illinois Criminal Justice Summit"                                    |

**Where to add alt text:**

- **Website/CMS** — Look for the "alt text" or "image description" field when uploading
- **Word documents** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **PowerPoint** — Right-click image > Edit Alt Text
- **Social media** — Each platform has an alt text option (see Social Media Accessibility section)
- **Email** — Outlook and Gmail both support alt text for images

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A</a> — All non-text content must have a text alternative

### How long should alt text be?

**Aim for 125 characters or fewer** — this is about 15-25 words. Some older screen readers truncate alt text at 125 characters, and shorter descriptions are easier for users to process.

- **Maximum:** Stay under 150 characters when possible
- **Ideal:** 125 characters or less
- **Too short:** Single words like "photo" or "image" don't help anyone
- **Too long:** If you need more than 150 characters, consider whether a visible caption would work better

**The bottom line:** If you took the photo because it captures something meaningful, that meaning needs to be conveyed in alt text for people who can't see it — but keep it concise.

### How do I handle complex images like charts, graphs, or infographics?

Some images — like charts, graphs, infographics, or images containing lots of text — need more than a brief alt text. Here's how to handle them:

**For charts and graphs with data:**

1. **Alt text:** Provide a brief summary of what the chart shows (e.g., "Bar chart showing Illinois crime rates declining 15% from 2020 to 2024")
2. **Data table:** Include the underlying data in an accessible table format, either directly below the chart or linked nearby
3. **Long description:** If the trends or patterns matter, describe them in the body text

**Example for a chart:**

- **Alt text:** "Line graph showing ICJIA grant funding from 2020-2025. Full data in table below."
- **Below the image:** An accessible HTML table with the actual numbers

**For infographics or images with lots of text:**

1. **Don't use images of text** — If possible, present the information as actual text on the page instead of as an image
2. **If you must use an image:** Provide the full text content in one of these ways:
   - A "long description" link that opens the full text
   - An expandable section below the image with the complete text
   - A text summary in the body of the page

**For scanned documents or PDF images:**

1. **Best approach:** Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the image to actual text
2. **If OCR isn't possible:** Provide a text transcript of the document content
3. **Alt text:** Describe what the document is (e.g., "Scanned letter from Governor dated June 2025. Full transcript below.")

**General rule for complex images:**

- **Alt text:** Brief summary + tell users where to find more detail
- **Long description:** Provide full information in accessible text format nearby or linked

**Example patterns:**

| Image Type       | Alt Text Approach                                     | Additional Requirement    |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Data chart       | "Chart showing [brief conclusion]. Data table below." | Accessible data table     |
| Infographic      | "Infographic about [topic]. Full text follows."       | Complete text version     |
| Scanned document | "[Document type] from [source]. Transcript provided." | Text transcript           |
| Complex diagram  | "Diagram of [subject]. Described in detail below."    | Detailed text description |

**WCAG Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#non-text-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content</a> — Complex images need text alternatives that serve equivalent purpose
- <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?levels=aa#images-of-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Criterion 1.4.5 Images of Text - Level AA</a> — Avoid images of text; use actual text when possible

### How do I make images accessible on social media, Constant Contact, or Canva?

Sharing infographics, charts, or images with text on platforms like social media, Constant Contact, or Canva presents unique challenges because you often can't add data tables or long descriptions directly.

**Social media (Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn):**

- **Alt text limits vary** — Most platforms allow 100-1000 characters for alt text, but keep it concise
- **Use the post text** — Put key information in the post caption itself, not just the image
- **Link to more** — If sharing a complex infographic, link to a webpage with the full accessible version
- **Don't rely on the image alone** — If the image contains important text or data, repeat it in your post

**Example social media approach:**

- **Image:** Infographic showing "5 Steps to Accessible Documents"
- **Alt text:** "Infographic listing 5 steps to create accessible documents. Steps listed in post."
- **Post text:** "Here are 5 steps to accessible documents: 1) Use heading styles, 2) Add alt text to images, 3) Use meaningful link text, 4) Check color contrast, 5) Run accessibility checker. Full guide: [link]"

**Constant Contact and email marketing:**

- **Alt text field:** Constant Contact has an alt text field for images — use it
- **Character limit:** Keep alt text brief since email clients vary in support
- **Avoid image-only emails** — Don't put critical information only in images; many users have images disabled by default
- **Provide text version** — Key messages should appear as actual text in the email, not just in graphics

**Example email approach:**

- **Image:** Event announcement graphic with date, time, location
- **Alt text:** "ICJIA Training Event - details in text below"
- **Email body:** Include all event details as actual text below the image

**Canva:**

- **Canva supports alt text** — When you download or share, Canva can include alt text
- **Better approach:** Export important text content separately, not just as an image
- **For presentations:** Use Canva's presentation mode which supports alt text, or export to PowerPoint and add alt text there
- **For print vs. digital:** If creating something for digital distribution, consider whether it needs to be an image at all

**General rule for social/email:**

If you're sharing a complex image on social media or email, ask yourself: "If someone can't see this image, can they still get the information?" If not, you need to provide the content as text — either in the post/email body or linked to an accessible page.

### Who should write the alt text for photos?

**Ideally, the person supplying the photo should also supply the alt text.** They know what's happening in the image, who's pictured, and why it matters. If you're submitting photos for the website, a newsletter, or social media, include alt text with your submission.

- **You were there** — You know the context, the names, and what made the moment significant
- **You chose the photo** — You selected it for a reason; that reason should be in the alt text
- **It saves time** — The web team or communications staff shouldn't have to guess who's in the photo or what event it's from

**Best practice:** When submitting photos, include a simple list: "Photo 1: [alt text], Photo 2: [alt text]" etc.

### Are captions the same as alt text?

**No — captions and alt text serve different purposes and both may be needed.**

|                 | Caption                                              | Alt Text                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visibility**  | Visible to everyone on the page                      | Hidden; only read by screen readers or shown if image fails to load |
| **Purpose**     | Provides context, credits, or additional information | Describes the image for people who can't see it                     |
| **Who sees it** | All users                                            | Users with screen readers, or when images don't load                |
| **Required?**   | Optional but often helpful                           | Required for accessibility                                          |

**Example of both working together:**

- **Alt text:** "Director Jane Smith presents the 2025 Excellence Award to Officer John Doe"
- **Caption:** "Officer John Doe receives the 2025 Excellence Award for his work on community violence intervention programs. Photo: ICJIA"

The alt text describes what's visually happening. The caption adds context that all readers benefit from (what the award was for, photo credit).

**When you might skip detailed alt text:**

- **Purely decorative images** — If a photo adds no meaningful information (like a decorative border), mark it as decorative. But event photos are almost never purely decorative.
- **Caption already describes it** — If there's a visible caption that fully describes the visual content, alt text can be briefer — but alt text is still required (even if just "Award ceremony as described in caption").

### Do all documents need to be accessible?

For public-facing documents, yes. Under both IITAA and ADA Title II, conventional electronic documents must be accessible, including:

- PDFs
- Word documents
- Excel spreadsheets
- PowerPoint presentations

**Exceptions may apply for:**

- Pre-existing documents not currently used for services (still must provide accessible alternatives upon request)
- Password-protected documents specific to an individual's account

### How do I make a Word document accessible?

Key steps for accessible Word documents:

1. **Use built-in heading styles** (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) — don't just make text bold and large
2. **Add alt text to images** — Right-click > Edit Alt Text
3. **Use simple table structures** — Avoid merged cells; designate header rows
4. **Use meaningful link text** — Not "click here"
5. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**
6. **Use built-in lists** — Bulleted and numbered lists from the ribbon
7. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

### How do I make a PDF accessible?

The best approach depends on the source:

**If you have the source document (Word, InDesign, etc.):**

1. Make the source document accessible first
2. Export to PDF with accessibility settings enabled
3. Check and fix any remaining issues in Adobe Acrobat Pro

**If you only have the PDF:**

1. Run the Accessibility Checker in Adobe Acrobat Pro
2. Add tags using the Reading Order tool
3. Add alt text to images
4. Set the document language
5. Verify reading order
6. Test with a screen reader

### Is Canva accessible?

Canva has made progress on accessibility features, including:

- Design Accessibility checker (checks contrast, alt text, typography)
- Automatic alt text suggestions
- Reading order and heading tagging for PDFs

**However:** Canva PDFs are not fully WCAG or PDF/UA compliant. If you use Canva:

- Use the Design Accessibility tool before exporting
- Check exported PDFs with PAC or Adobe Acrobat
- Be prepared to remediate PDFs in Adobe Acrobat Pro
- Simpler designs produce better accessibility results

### How do I make Excel spreadsheets accessible?

Key steps for accessible Excel files:

1. **Use a simple, logical structure** — Avoid blank rows/columns for spacing
2. **Name worksheets descriptively** — Not "Sheet1," "Sheet2"
3. **Define table headers** — Format as Table with header row
4. **Add alt text to charts and images**
5. **Avoid merged cells** when possible
6. **Use sufficient color contrast**
7. **Don't rely on color alone** to convey information
8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

### How do I make PowerPoint presentations accessible?

Key steps for accessible PowerPoint:

1. **Use built-in slide layouts** — Don't create from blank slides
2. **Add alt text to images, charts, and graphics**
3. **Ensure reading order is correct** — Home > Arrange > Selection Pane
4. **Use unique, descriptive slide titles**
5. **Use sufficient color contrast**
6. **Make hyperlinks descriptive**
7. **Add captions to embedded videos**
8. **Run the Accessibility Checker** — Review tab > Check Accessibility

## Social Media Accessibility

### Do social media posts need to be accessible?

Yes. Under the ADA Title II rule, new social media posts by state and local governments must meet accessibility standards. Pre-existing posts (before the compliance deadline) are exempt.

**Note:** Social media platforms themselves have accessibility limitations, but you can control the content you post.

**ADA Title II Reference:**

- <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADA Title II Web Rule - Social Media</a> (see section on "Social Media Posts")

### How do I make social media posts accessible?

**For all platforms:**

- Write in plain language
- Use CamelCase for hashtags (#AccessibilityMatters)
- Limit emoji use; don't place multiple emojis together
- Put hashtags at the end of posts
- Keep videos captioned
- Use sufficient color contrast in graphics

**For images:**

- Add alt text (most platforms support this now)
- Don't put essential text only in images
- Describe images in the post if alt text isn't available

**For video:**

- Add captions (not just auto-generated — review for accuracy)
- Provide audio description for essential visual content if needed

### How do I add alt text on different platforms?

- **X (Twitter):** When composing, click the image > "Add description"
- **Facebook:** Click the image > Edit > Alternative Text
- **Instagram:** Advanced Settings > Write Alt Text (or edit after posting)
- **LinkedIn:** Click the image while composing > Alt text

## Procurement and Third-Party Tools

### What should I do when purchasing software or services?

When procuring technology products or services:

1. **Include accessibility requirements** in RFPs and contracts
2. **Request accessibility documentation** from vendors — Ask for accessibility conformance reports or documentation that addresses WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
3. **Evaluate accessibility claims** — Look for "Supports" not just "Partially Supports"
4. **Request a demo** of accessibility features
5. **Test with assistive technology** if possible

### What contract language should I use?

Illinois DoIT recommends including language similar to:

> "All information technology, including electronic information, software, systems, and equipment, developed or provided under this contract or procurement must comply with the applicable requirements of the Illinois Information Technology Accessibility Act (30 ILCS 587) Standards as published at <a href="https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doit.illinois.gov/accessibility/iitaa</a>"
