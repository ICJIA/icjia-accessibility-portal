# Legal Language Softening - FAQ Updates

## Date: December 31, 2025

## Purpose

To reduce language that could be interpreted as a non-lawyer providing legal advice or interpretation. The FAQ now focuses on explaining federal and state **compliance requirements** rather than making legal determinations.

## Key Principle

**Changed from:** Making statements about "legal requirements" or "legal obligations"  
**Changed to:** Describing "compliance requirements" or "requirements under ADA Title II and IITAA"

This approach:
- Grounds claims in specific regulations (ADA Title II, IITAA)
- Avoids positioning the FAQ author as interpreting law
- Still conveys the binding nature of the requirements
- Makes it clear that requirements come from DOJ/DoIT, not the FAQ author

## Specific Changes Made (24 instances)

**After:** "This is the compliance standard required by ADA Title II and IITAA"

### 4. Deadline language
**Before:** "The April 24, 2026 deadline is a fixed legal requirement"  
**After:** "The April 24, 2026 deadline is a fixed compliance requirement"

**Before:** "The April 2026 deadline is federal law"  
**After:** "The April 2026 deadline is specified in the ADA Title II rule"

### 5. Compliance/enforcement language
**Before:** "These are legal obligations, not suggestions"  
**After:** "The language mirrors the binding nature of ADA Title II and IITAA requirements"

**Before:** "Content that meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA is compliant with current legal requirements"  
**After:** "Content that meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA is compliant with current federal requirements"

### 6. Source attribution
**Before:** "Legal requirements — All information about deadlines..."

**Before:** "For legal/mandate questions, ask DoIT"

**After:** "fulfill program requirements"

**Before:** "The legal requirement is full compliance"  
**After:** "The compliance requirement is full WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance"

## Result

The FAQ now consistently:
1. ✅ References specific regulations (ADA Title II, IITAA) rather than generic "law"
2. ✅ Uses "compliance requirements" instead of "legal requirements"
3. ✅ Attributes requirements to DOJ/DoIT sources
4. ✅ Avoids positioning the author as providing legal interpretation
5. ✅ Maintains the urgency and binding nature of requirements
6. ✅ Still clearly communicates that these are mandatory, not optional

## What This Doesn't Change

- The substance of any requirement
- The April 24, 2026 deadline
- The need for compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- The enforceability of ADA Title II and IITAA
- The accountability mechanisms

## Why This Matters

As a web developer (not an attorney), framing the FAQ as explaining "compliance requirements under ADA Title II and IITAA" rather than interpreting "legal requirements" is more accurate and defensible. The FAQ cites official sources (DOJ, DoIT, W3C) and explains what those sources require—it doesn't provide legal advice or make legal determinations.

This approach:
- Reduces perceived overreach by non-legal staff
- Makes clear that requirements come from regulatory authorities
- Still effectively communicates binding obligations
- Better positions the FAQ as informational rather than advisory
