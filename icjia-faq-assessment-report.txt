ICJIA ACCESSIBILITY FAQ ASSESSMENT REPORT
==========================================
Generated: December 31, 2025
Document Reviewed: Digital Accessibility FAQ for Illinois State Agency Employees

==========================================
OVERALL GRADE: A- (92/100)
==========================================

This is a comprehensive, well-sourced, and professionally written FAQ 
that would serve your agency well. The verification work confirms the 
factual accuracy. The document is ready for leadership review with 
only minor refinements needed.

==========================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
==========================================

STRENGTHS:
• Factually accurate and properly sourced to authoritative references
• Comprehensive coverage of roles, content types, and scenarios
• Practical, actionable guidance with clear examples
• Diplomatic tone that explains *why* without being preachy
• Smart structure with quick-reference tables and role-based entry points

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
• Some redundancy between sections that could be consolidated
• A few tone inconsistencies in newer sections
• Minor structural issues in question organization
• One claim still needs softened attribution (PDF/HTML recommendation)

==========================================
1. ACCURACY ASSESSMENT: ✅ VERIFIED
==========================================

All major claims trace to authoritative sources:

CLAIM                              SOURCE                        STATUS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
April 24, 2026 deadline            Federal Register 89 FR 31320  ✅ Exact
WCAG 2.1 Level AA standard         ADA Title II Rule §35.200     ✅ Exact
IITAA 2.1 effective June 24, 2024  Illinois DoIT                 ✅ Exact
Five exceptions to rule            §35.201                       ✅ Complete
Third-party tool responsibility    ADA.gov Fact Sheet            ✅ Verified
No routine extension process       Federal Register (full text)  ✅ Verified
Title II applies since 1996        ADA.gov / Fed. Register       ✅ Verified

ONE MINOR ATTRIBUTION ISSUE REMAINS:

The FAQ states: "As Illinois DoIT generally recommends, publishing 
content as webpage text when feasible..."

ISSUE: DoIT's PDF guide doesn't explicitly state this. The recommendation 
comes from CITL (University of Illinois) and general best practice sources 
(Cornell IT, WebAIM).

RECOMMENDATION: Change to:
"Accessibility experts generally recommend publishing content as webpage 
text when feasible. As Cornell IT notes, 'Remediating PDFs for web 
accessibility can be more time consuming than creating a webpage.'"

==========================================
2. TONE ASSESSMENT: A-
==========================================

WHAT WORKS WELL:
• Direct without being condescending
• Explains the "why" behind requirements
• Acknowledges real constraints (time, resources, competing priorities)
• Uses "you" appropriately to connect with readers
• Avoids jargon or explains it when used

MINOR TONE ISSUES TO ADDRESS:

1. "Why is this FAQ so long?" — The opening reads slightly defensive.
   
   CURRENT: "Accessibility is complex — there's no one-click fix..."
   
   SUGGESTED: "Accessibility touches every role and content type. This 
   FAQ is comprehensive so you can find answers specific to your 
   situation without searching multiple sources."

2. "The tone of this FAQ feels directive" question — Well-handled but 
   could be shorter. Currently ~800 words; could be tightened to ~400 
   words without losing substance.

3. Liability section (commented out) — Good decision to comment this 
   out for now. If activated, have legal review the framing.

==========================================
3. STRUCTURE ASSESSMENT: B+
==========================================

STRONG POINTS:
• Role-based quick reference at top is excellent
• Logical progression from general → specific
• Good use of "See also" cross-references
• Tables improve scannability

STRUCTURAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS:

A. SECTION ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS

"General Accessibility Questions" is too long (14 questions). 
Consider splitting:

CURRENT                              SUGGESTED SPLIT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
General Accessibility Questions      Understanding Accessibility (5 Qs):
(14 Qs)                               - What is digital accessibility
                                      - Why deadline exists
                                      - What WCAG means
                                     
                                     Getting Oriented (5 Qs):
                                      - FAQ length explanation

                                      - Everyone's responsibility

B. QUESTIONS IN WRONG SECTIONS

QUESTION                                    CURRENT          BETTER LOCATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
"Do we need an accessibility coordinator?" Getting Started  State Agency or 
                                                            new "Agency Planning"
"What am I accountable for as manager?"    Getting Started  After "I'm a manager"
"Track good-faith progress"                Getting Started  State Agency 
                                                            (compliance-focused)
"ICJIA audit reports"                      Getting Started  ICJIA-Specific or
                                                            Website Accessibility

C. MISSING LOGICAL FLOW

The "Getting Started" section mixes:
• Role-based starting points (good)
• Manager accountability (should follow manager start)
• Agency-wide planning (belongs elsewhere)
• ICJIA-specific content (needs its own home)

RECOMMENDED "GETTING STARTED" STRUCTURE:
1. I'm a content creator. Where do I start?
2. I'm a web developer. Where do I start?
3. I'm a manager. Where do I start?
4. What exactly am I accountable for as a manager?
5. How can I track "good-faith progress"?

Move coordinator and ICJIA-specific questions elsewhere.

==========================================
4. REDUNDANCY ASSESSMENT: B
==========================================

REDUNDANT CONTENT IDENTIFIED:

TOPIC                    APPEARS IN                      RECOMMENDATION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PDF vs. HTML             4 questions (content creator,   Keep full explanation
recommendation           documents, PDF, emails)         in ONE place; cross-
                                                         reference from others

April 2026 deadline      8+ questions                    Acceptable repetition
is firm                                                  for emphasis

"Run Accessibility       Word, PDF, Excel, PPT           Acceptable (contextual)
Checker"                 sections

Who to contact           4+ questions                    Could consolidate into
(DoIT, web developers)                                   one definitive answer

Third-party tool         5 questions (widgets,           Good progressive detail,
responsibility           testing, DocuSign, LMS,         but intro could be
                         Tableau)                        shorter

SPECIFIC CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES:

1. PDF/HTML RECOMMENDATION appears in 4 places with nearly identical 
   wording. Suggest:
   
   • Keep full explanation in "Do all documents need to be accessible?"
   • In other locations, use: "Best practice: Consider publishing as 
     webpage text instead of PDF when feasible. See: [Do all documents 
     need to be accessible?] for details."

2. "WHO TO CONTACT" guidance appears in:
   • "I prefer to talk to someone..."
   • "Can managers delay accessibility work..."
   • "This website was generated by a web developer..."
   • "I'm waiting for a presentation..."
   
   Consider creating one definitive "Who to contact for what" question 
   and cross-referencing.

==========================================
TRIAGED IMPROVEMENT LIST
==========================================

TIER 1: FIX BEFORE SHARING (30 minutes)
─────────────────────────────────────────

1. SOFTEN PDF/HTML ATTRIBUTION
   Change "Illinois DoIT generally recommends" to cite Cornell IT/CITL 
   directly or frame as "accessibility best practice"

2. MOVE MISPLACED QUESTIONS
   At minimum, move "ICJIA has many public sites" out of Getting Started

3. TIGHTEN "WHY IS THIS FAQ SO LONG?"
   Remove defensive tone from quick answer

TIER 2: IMPROVE WHEN POSSIBLE (1-2 hours)
─────────────────────────────────────────

4. SPLIT "GENERAL ACCESSIBILITY QUESTIONS"
   Too many questions in one bucket; break into 2-3 subsections

5. CONSOLIDATE "WHO TO CONTACT" GUIDANCE
   Create one definitive answer and cross-reference

6. REDUCE PDF/HTML REPETITION
   Keep full explanation in one place; use brief cross-references elsewhere

7. SHORTEN "THE TONE FEELS DIRECTIVE" ANSWER
   Cut from ~800 words to ~400 words

TIER 3: NICE TO HAVE (future updates)
─────────────────────────────────────────

8. ADD "HOW DO WE HANDLE ACCESSIBILITY COMPLAINTS?"
   Practical gap in current coverage

9. CREATE ICJIA-SPECIFIC SECTION
   For audit reports, agency-specific tools, internal resources

10. REVIEW GETTING STARTED SECTION STRUCTURE
    Ensure logical flow from role → accountability → tracking

==========================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION
==========================================

THIS FAQ IS READY FOR LEADERSHIP REVIEW.

The factual content is accurate and well-sourced. The tone is appropriate 
for the audience and situation. The structure works well enough that 
readers will find what they need.

The Tier 1 fixes are minor and take 30 minutes. Make those changes, then 
share with confidence. The Tier 2 improvements can happen in a future 
revision after you've gathered feedback on how people actually use the 
document.

FOR YOUR DUBIOUS AUDIENCE:

Every claim links to DOJ, DoIT, or W3C. If they want to challenge 
something, they're challenging the Department of Justice, not you. The 
FAQ doesn't add requirements beyond what the law specifies — it just 
explains those requirements clearly.

The comprehensive source verification performed earlier confirms:
• Federal deadlines: Exact match to Federal Register
• Illinois requirements: Exact match to DoIT documentation
• Technical standards: Exact match to WCAG/W3C
• Exceptions: Complete and accurate per §35.201
• No unsupported claims that could undermine credibility
